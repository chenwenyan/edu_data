One thought was that there may be telling information regarding what countries are the subject of the searches from other countries.  This is most easily detected by keyword searches, but a little more subtly can be done with the country part of the URL (e.g. ""xx.yy.ru""), and finally using the IP address, which ultimately maps to a specific country, or even city.  Of particular interest might be what is the subject and source country of a search from an originating country.  A very interesting discovery would be if there's any evidence that if country ""A"" most often searches for topics about an ""advanced"" country ""B"" (or C, D, etc) from the first world, if that becomes a leading indicator or precursor to country A's emergence into the first world over time.",2015-04-20 00:54:01 UTC,,19

Looking at the properties, I see that the basis for the PDF is a file produced by a desktop publishing program, probably Microsoft Publisher.

PDF creators which are not from Adobe often fail to conform 100% to the PDF specification, and this can manifest itself only when performing more ""unusual"" operations such as copying and pasting between different software applications (that's why such defects are frequently not discovered during the software testing phase). A possible solution might be to create the PDF from Word rather than Publisher and use Adobe Distiller rather than ScanSoft PDF Create! 7 (though WBS would have to do that).
That said, if you just want to highlight certain parts of the text, you can do this directly in the PDF using the free Adobe Reader application.

However, von Ahn makes several bold claims in relation to his duolingo website, such as that people can really learn a language just by translating it - the method ""really works."" However, the ""grammar-translation"" method of language learning has been ridiculed for years by language pedagogists. There is more to learning a language than just translating it.
Also, he claims that just because people pay $500 for language learning software, this unequivocally means they ""really, really want to learn a new language."" There are many smokers who have paid more than $500 for measures to give up smoking - does this mean they""really, really want to"" give up? If so, why do so many fail or relapse?
Von Ahn's ""quality assurance"" system is a quantitative one - if a number of learners translate a sentence in the same way, then it must be translated accurately. So quantity assures quality. This may work in some cases, but it is highly unlikely to work in all cases, especially as naive language learners are concerned.

This talk was given four years ago. Is there any evidence that the method has worked?Have people really learned a foreign language just through duolingo?
Is all of the English Wikipedia now available in Spanish too? From a cursory glance, that does not seem to be the case - there is no Spanish translation of the Wikipedia articles on Hinckley and Kenilworth, for example, despite von Ahn's claims that ""if we wanted to translate Wikipedia into Spanish, we could do it in five weeks with 100,000 active users.

An interesting perspective. 

The politicians of today already have – in my opinion – their hands on the data that show the traces we leave in cyberspace.
In the first instance, GCHQ and other intelligence agencies, do a vast amount of tracking and logging of what we do: remember we are, to them, all guilty of something until we can prove otherwise. But besides their interest in the minutia of our simple lives in cyberspace, they and agencies employed to them, use this data to map out policies which they think will make the greatest impact to our lives. 

In the second instance, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) don’t just carry out surveys and get people to complete questionnaires; that would be too unreliable a collection method, so they must collect and used data from elsewhere.

I put it to you that there is more ‘link-up’ of the data which get collected by surveillance, and the listening agencies than we (the less interest) are made to believe is actually happening.

What's painted as a generic future orientation in fact relates only to behaviour around the turn of the year. If overlayed and plotted from July to June, all you'd see is a bump caused by the change of calendar. The differences between countries are differences at that time of year, nothing else.
For example, in the UK, Christmas and New Year is effectively a two-week partial shutdown, when we have too much spare time in the darkest days and nastiest weather of the year. Traditionally, many people then plan spring and summer holidays (and many more yearn for them!). No surprise to see high future orientation here.

- a sample of (say) a hundred students from all over NY tend collectively to recognise well-trodden parts of Manhattan better than The Bronx (to name a couple of examples).
- it causes additional 'cognitive load' when navigating to have to figure out where you are all the time because you are having trouble recognising your surroundings.
- therefore inhabitants of The Bronx suffer lower well-being than inhabitants of Manhattan

That third step makes no sense to me - surely this could only be claimed on the basis of a study of how well Manhattanites recognise Manhattan vs how well Bronxites recognise The Bronx (etc), which wasn't what Milgram studied.

I don't doubt there is a correlation between recognisability and well-being but we have not been presented with nearly enough data to conclude that there is causation (and it seems a far-fetched hypothesis anyway, with third factors such as commercial, cultural and environmental facilities much more likely to explain the correlation).",2015-04-20 16:48:55 UTC,,5

It is of interest that the Future Oriented Index/GDP correlation rose from 0.53 (2008), to 0.64 (2009), to 0.78 (2010). It would be of value to examine:

1.	Data that is available on line such as share-price feeds from global futures stock markets to help to anticipate price fluctuations. This has to be legal at the request level but I feel it would have interesting effects on prices: massive volatility. It could however be highly profitable.
2.	Promotion aid for all kinds of products – by the use of time, location and keywords. What sells best where? Is the current advertising campaign working?
3.	All kind of trend analysis: is a political speech/newspaper coverage with certain keywords included e.g. ‘austerity’, ‘we are all in this together’, more or less effective. Number of and repetition of key words in requests.
4.	The study of rumour on the internet – very dangerous as it is self-reinforcing.

I've had a particular interest in Data Analysis/ Statistics courses over the past 5 or 6 months, and completed the Data course run by Futurelearn last year, and a couple of Stats courses with Coursera. From your profile, it looks like you've been quite busy yourself!

I note from your profile you live at Lancaster and work at the Uni. I know Lancaster well - I live therefore myself! (The UK Lancaster, not the American one!) Small world....

Perhaps there is something interesting there, did the German economy grow because in that area people were looking forward, or were they looking forward hoping that it would?

Also is GDP per capita good data upon which to build theory about the behaviour of crowds, as there is also an issue about income inequality. In the region around Germany income inequality was growing at a faster rate than previously, in 2010. So it may not have been optimism about the future that drove the searches, but pessimism.

Similarly, people are interested in savings around this time- so we can work with NGOs to increase savings behavior and tie it to New Year's resolutions.

In terms of timing, you could also look at when and where people need help that has stigma- searches for domestic violence support or HIV testing.

Your other statement for example: ""As a librarian in a university we try to teach our students how to do effective searching. It would be fascinating to know what they actually searched for."" I agree with both of your statements though and I get to apply this in my work at a university both protecting privacy and providing data access for research analytics.

Generally, as long as someone cannot be re-identified, and the information was posted freely and publicly, the data is legally available for use. In the case of studying the predictability of behaviours of people for government planning or commercial purposes, one has to impose ethical standards on the use of such data, especially where re-identification might be possible. If data is aggregate, summarized, and anonymized, then ethics, rather than privacy becomes the key concern.

Open data would emply that city budgets are published, examined, vetoed by the citizens, which is never the case and open data from a government point of view is a myth.
Policies are not in the public domain, neither the policy deciding.  Therefore, we cannot influence any
city government solely on data collected.  If that data cannot be used , why keeping it?  
On second thoughts, we have the potential of reducing the environmental pollution. But do governments 
acknowledge the percentage of pollution aviation is causing?  City governments will not approve of a building project purely on infrastructure issues.  Economics and private lobbying will prevail.
It seems to me as if the citizens may have the relevant freedom but also restricted by governments.

From a primitive pen and paper ‘tick list’ approach we have moved on to a largely mechanised study of actions and movement: groups instead of individuals. Sophisticated software exists to plan out likely connections and links between people, locations, times and dates + related probabilities.

I guess that in any individual transaction only details of the amount and retailer are passed to the card company.  However, I assume that if you use the same credit card in the same retailer regularly, a major supermarket for example, they have the ability to bring together all of your transactions to understand things such as products you frequently buy and the locations these are bought in.  I suppose that they could even get information about the card holder to make the same relationship across purchases on different credit cards.  Obviously this could be used to inform health insurance or life assurance decisions etc.  Essentially meaning that even if you keep away from loyalty cards because you don't want to reveal too much information about yourself, this exact same information can be pulled together just because you have used your credit card.

Does anyone have any insight on how much:
- Tracking of credit card transaction history is done and how detailed this is?
- How much data such as loyalty card info is being used to inform big decisions being made about us, such as whether to pay out on a life assurance policy?

I don't think that this relatively small future orientation underpins the economic success of more affluent nations.  Higher disposable income brings choices for planning future utility and pleasure; things not open to people whose priorities are making ends meet. In  addition, greater prosperity drives aspiration for current and future ownership of material goods and experiences, many of which will be researched, sourced using search engines, and purchased using the internet.

Also we need to be realistic about the reliability of the data. There are many example highlighted below, but put simply there is a real danger of assuming that because someone searches for a product they are interested in it or like it, when in fact it could be quite the opposite.

I would lean towards a definition of big data  as data that is collected automatically as a byproduct of people (or things) doing what they do.  

Technology (cheap sensors, the Internet - and the internet of things - low cost computer storage and processing power) has now meant that data can be stored for the sake of it and researchers can analyse it out of curiosity and where there are exciting discoveries to be made.

For example, I was interested to read that Mercedes were able to link the activation of anti-lock breaking with the geo-location from the cars sat-nav system to identify dangerous black-spots on the road network.  This was not the intention when they fitted the sensors to monitor anti-loc use. Then, if I recall correctly, it was used on their sat-nav systems to warn other car users.

Also, if the only keywords we can investigate are years in arabic numerals, this line of research is going to run out of fuel very quickly. Translation engines should not be used blindly, however. Keyword searches are one context; a translation for another context (eg a dictionary) would not necessarily yield reliable results. There are variations even within the same language here. As Gerry McGovern has pointed out elsewhere, we need to know what expressions people use to search even in English alone: ""cheap flights"" is far more common than ""low air fares"", for instance.

Be interesting to see whether there are, in fact, a whole bunch of people who would cycle if it were safer/more convenient. Instead of questionnaires, which is the traditional way, we could collate search data. Are people in a specific area looking online for bikes, helmets, road maps, routes into the city etc? 

I'm also taken with the video someone shared earlier in which traffic speeds around New York city were calculated by getting data from taxis' GPS recorder using FOI request.

What Big Data can do however is to correlate actual events (such as admissions for ebola) and tack the spread of the disease as well as plot those connections made by people who have been exposed and may be infectious while travelling.

We try to control experiments as much as we can in order to increase the internal validity, usually at the expense of external validity. Along with this, when subjects know that they are participating in an experiment they can consciously fake info they provide (I am thinking of some psychological experiments for example) for many reasons (for example because they want to  give a good impression of themselves), however using Big Data we are collecting more objective pieces of info, imagine for example the use of Oyster card, is that info true? yes, it is as it reflects behaviours people make. The biggest problem here would be to know how to use that info collected in order to guide hypothesis with sense. On the other hand, if we collect info in a river using a sensor for example, we are collecting true info, but the validity of that info and then its accuracy will depend more on the measure instrument we are using than the collected data themselves.",2015-04-22 13:23:08 UTC,,3

... a broad term for data sets so large or complex that traditional data processing applications are inadequate. Challenges include analysis, capture, curation, search, sharing, storage, transfer, visualization, and information privacy. The term often refers simply to the use of predictive analytics or other certain advanced methods to extract value from data, and seldom to a particular size of data set
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data
... an evolving term that describes any voluminous amount of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data that has the potential to be mined for information. Although big data doesn't refer to any specific quantity, the term is often used when speaking about petabytes and exabytes of data.
http://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/definition/big-data-Big-Data
In Big Data@Work, Tom Davenport concludes that because of “the problems with the definition” of big data, “I (and other experts I have consulted) predict a relatively short life span for this unfortunate term.”

Essentially we are trading our data for some service: we allow Google to know what we search for because it helps to develop better algorithms for searching (and sell advertising!), Amazon is able to recommend things we might like based on our purchase history.

However my colleague used the numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 because the probability of that combination is the same as any other. I noticed that no consecutive sequence had ever occurred neither had equally spaced numbers come up. The numbers drawn tended to come in clusters Eg, 2 5 23 25 29 47. 
I calculated a ""bunching index"" to describe these distributions. I wrote a program that could generate random numbers with the most probable index and these looked like genuine draws. After running many trials some past winning numbers were reproduced. I used the program to give me some new numbers to enter into the lottery. Although the theory continues to work why I haven't won anything?
The conclusion: An interesting discovery doesn't necessarily have a practical application.

If the word ABC has three meanings in language 1. And the meaning we are interested in is represented by word DEF in language 2.

(So we have two different types of interference). The words themselves aren't transliterations, for example Germans do not use German as if it had been translated word for word from English. This makes normalising search terms across different languages a VERY complicated problem. I don't think there is one way of doing it that is going to work across all language sets. It's hard enough if you just restrict yourself to romance languages that all have a fairly similar structure.

Google Translate uses statistical methods to decide the best translation on the basis of phrases already translated by humans.

- World Cup searches peaks in June every 4 years at the start of the World Cup Football
- Summer searches peaks at the last 2 months of the Spring, which monts depends on the timezone.

""Big data"" is simply a rebranding of something we have been doing for a long time. Go back 15 years and I was involved in the latest exciting idea - ""knowledge management"" - which was basically data-mining structured, semistructured and unstructured data.   Try this exercise: use Google trends and look up ""knowledge management"" - you'll see a trend curve peaking at 2004 and gradually declining to today; now search ""big data"" instead - steep upward trend curve from around 2010.

So my hypothesis is that Big Data is simply a rebranding of Knowledge Management. Why? Because academia requires such re-presentation of ideas to maintain funding. My forecast is that ""Big Data"" will start to decline as an expression soon and be replaced by another catchy phrase in about 5-10 years time (or even sooner in days of accelerating change). Cynical? Maybe. For me the crucial concept is not the method of data analysis but the ""understanding"" - the ability to discern and not draw conclusions from spurious correlations - the challenge of the information age! ☺☺",2015-04-23 08:02:24 UTC,,14

No matter how rigorously attempts are made to be neutral there may well be some of this framing taking place. Which is why differently worded questionnaires achieve different and conflicting opinions from the same population sample.

Human behavior is actually, at many levels, generally predictable and there are a number of neuroeconomic decision making theories, especially for simple decision making, that appear to be robust. It may be that advances in this area will enable societies to be essentially manipulated and data used to refine and reinforce this manipulation. Which is pretty scary when you think about it.

""To make it easier to compare search data, results in Google Trends are normalized. If they weren't normalized, regions with the most search volume would always be ranked highest.

Normalized means that sets of search data are divided by a common variable, like total searches, to cancel out the variable's effect on the data.

Trends data is relative, not absolute
Just because two regions show the same number for a particular search term doesn't mean that their absolute, or total, search volumes are the same.

Data from two regions with significant differences in search volumes can be compared equally because the data has been normalized by the total searches from each region.

For example, users in Fiji and Canada may have the same search numbers if they're equally likely to search for hotel. However, they may not have the same number of total searches for this term.

Some terms may not appear as top search terms in an area. This doesn't mean that this term isn't popular in that area, but it's not as popular as other terms.""

Yes I agree that we now have more data sources and different processing tools but those were exactly the same arguments used by the commercial suppliers of KM 15 years ago. It still comes back to the quality and bias of data coupled with an understanding of the validity of any particular type of analysis.  We've already seen mentoin in a number of posts of the old statistical chestnut of correlation and causation but this becomes even more complex with incresing size of the data sources because statistically you are more likely to get correlations as the number of independent analyses you perform increases.  The area IS exciting but it has to be tempered by careful analysis of any presumed conclusions resulting especially from masses of soft data.

For this reason I am somewhat sceptical about the ""future orientation"" example - not sure what they are trying to say.  Also the oystercard research is interesting but lacks 'validity' in the true social science meaning of the word.  To the results I would say ""so what?"" though it does serve as an interesting pointer to further research. ",2015-04-23 18:24:14 UTC,,3

However I found it interesting that he reconstructed the experiment from the 70's - as he says in his TED talk , he used computer method to replicate social sciences experiment. So, this is what is really interesting. He saved lot of time - the time that would be spend on recruiting interviewees,  interviewing them, transcribing the answers and analyzing them. 

The only pitfall I see is that moving from off line to an on line experiment on line, one loses the personal info on the users. The public become uniform to a researcher. Quercia finds out how people see the city, how they use it, but he doesn't find out who this people are. An elegant solution to this is using the information from census.

P.S.  I checked Quercia's profile and came across a nice talk he did at Ted (https://www.ted.com/talks/daniele_quercia_happy_maps?language=en). Now, this talk makes much more sense.

I was amazed to see India had an index of 100 compared to 2 in the uk in terms of searches, and when I looked at the graph and compared India and the UK there was some correlation - both charts started in around 2004/5, peaked around 2008 then fell off to today.  What was happening? Does India have mad cow disease? Well googling ""India BSE"" brings up the Bombay stock exchange, not mad cow disease.  2 lessons:-
- Ensure you understand your data definition really clearly
- Completely unrelated data can have an accidental correlation
... however thinking further, maybe there should be some correlation - the large indian diaspora in the uk may be interested in the Bombay stock exchange and this might explain some of the correlation - few people are googling for the disease and my starting assumption was completely wrong!!!",2015-04-23 18:49:14 UTC,,17

I read somewhere that 5 or 6 pieces of anonymous information added together can identify the individual.
In Ireland they are soon to introduce a post code that will identify each home address individually. Not happy with this. Just think of what the marketers will with the data. Any time you are entering in your address on a website it will be mandatory to fill on your post code. This will generate huge (sellable) data.

Thank you for your thoughtful comment. I agree with you for the good use of big data.

First, we should establish security to protect our privacy and right to ask deleting our record if the owner wants.

I am wondering whether this data could have global security uses, for better or worse. Could it be used as an early warning system for the detection of  groups like ISIS?  Could it have been used to detect greater traffic in certain travel destinations which suddenly attract more enquiries? I am also wondering whether political parties could extract data from search engines rather than do direct telephone polling of 'representative' groups within their constituencies. Internet search engines are an indication of what human beings are thinking about, but there are serious limitations in the data if we are limited to knowing what is going on inside people's heads.

It is treating the city like one big organism, monitoring its vital signs to make therapeutic adjustments to keep its vital signs going. The discipline of city planning has been around for a while, but CUSP seems to be expanding its role into all sorts of new areas. It's very exciting. 
Singapore is one example of a modern city that uses data very effectively to inform its decision-making. It would be interesting to know whether Singapore is collaborating with CUSP.  I would also like to know whether my home town, Melbourne, Australia (often topping the list for the world's most liveable city) could have a role to play with CUSP.  I'm not aware of what type of big data, if any, Melbourne's decision-makers are collecting and analysing to monitor the pulse of the city. 

One final thought - maybe its time the United Nations established a CUSP- like body to monitor the life of the whole planet. We have the technology to do it and, thanks to the internet, we can collect the big data to do it. ",2015-04-24 04:57:28 UTC,,12

Of course we know the answer to this one, because the search is recent and the bucket challenge is remembered by many. But many of the searches will be obscure .

You could use Google search data to build predictive models for people's behaviour when facing a (model) situation.

We had some interesting perception data which made it clear that people trusted private sector data owners - such as banks and Google much more than they did the government. It was a period when there was quite a lot in the media about data loss from tax and health authorities which will have contributed to it and there is probably a link to perceptions oof private sector bodies being more competent than oublic sector ones.

In these area’s these kind of things are often spread via other communication routes (eg newspapers, flyers, speaking with friend/family/neighbors). But it makes more sense to look up things from the past as they are memories and memories are not always completely true, complete and full with opinions.

Because the elections might be a big part of the results in certain years and in certain countries (though they say that they find similar  relationships in 2008, 2009 and 2010). But there are also countries where there is almost no effect by this. May it be because they don’t have elections every few year/there is not that massive interest in the elections or it is not googled in combination with the year (if there is a big event the next year, it is rarely happens that you won’t get to the website you’re looking for if you just google that event (even without the year)). 

I think that things that are not annual have a big impact on the future orientation index (may it be elections, Olympic games, that big accident that happened the previous year, the airing of that serie/movie/book/music album that you love), but there are so many of them that they probably often balance each other out.

Just a quick note to thank you for all the excellent comments and ideas shared on our Big Data MOOC so far. We are really delighted to see so much engagement on both the FutureLearn platform and on Twitter using the hashtag #FLbigdata.

Given the impressive speed with which you are coming up with questions, we will not be able to comment on all of them - the idea is to give you a chance to explore ideas and opportunities in the area of big data together with your fellow learners.

But we will be keeping an eye on all the discussion - and, in each week, we will record a round up video in which we explore some of the themes of the discussion.

Keep your wonderful comments and ideas coming! We will try and pick up as many of them in our weekly round up videos.

With best wishes,

I looked for the terms paleo, vegan, gluten free, vegetarian and low carb to see if attitudes towards food were changing.

Worldwide interest in paleo, gluten free and vegan has been steadily increasing with vegetarian staying at a similar level. Low carb had a peak before 2005 and then dropped  (maybe because of the popularity of the Atkins diet). There were also some predictable peaks in January.

I wondered whether there were differences between developed and newly industrialized countries. In a few developed countries there was interest in all with a slow increase but it didn't hold in all cases. Likewise for newly industrialized countries some had a long interest in vegan/vegetarian with others only gaining searches in more recent years but not enough for a pattern. 

I didn't find the patterns I expected to. Maybe I view things from a fixed English-speaking perspective. Are these terms even used in other countries?

However, it has to be clarified whether a country such as India, which has a population over one billion, is skewing the analysis of the data set; because although a smaller percentage of the population, relative to more advanced countries, has access to the Internet, the large size of the population will numerically compensate for this smaller percentage.

In conclusion, from the information made available from the data set, it would appear there is a higher number of searches referring to the past date of 2009, but in contrast it is being postulated that it is the less developed countries, with less Internet access, that search for dates in the past, and this does not lead to clear support for the hypotheses being put forward to explain this ratio.",2015-04-24 20:28:40 UTC,,0

A richer source of country data of many kinds is at Hans Rosling's Gapminder website. (Google ""Gapminder data""). Its sources are all referenced (unlike the CIA); GDP and internet users both come from the World Bank. Nine of the 44 user populations for 2009 differ by more than 10% from the CIA Factbook, including the USA; Kazakhstan is well below your cutoff. Gapminder's data cover several years.

I'm not sure if the problem is as big as some people fear it is, or indeed whether there *is* a problem. In the good old days, we went to the grocer in his corner shop, who of course knew us well, and what our preferences and dislikes were. This allowed the shopkeeper to bring to our attention any special offers that might be of interest. What the retailers do now is, effectively, a modern, automated version - with one exception: it's a machine that knows our preferences and dislikes, not a person any more.
It's important to remember at we are in control of what we spend our money on: Big Data can make us offers that are more aligned with our preferences, but we make the final decision whether or not to buy.

The results for summer are interesting as there are two summers each year - northern and southern hemispheres. The peaks in the trends coincide solely with northern summers, though some years suggest a much smaller peak around January/February. The results are likely a result of the disparity in populations between the two hemispheres, in turn a reflection of their different geography.

Looking solely at Australia the results peak, as might be expected, in December - the height of summer in the south. There was a much larger peak in the results for October 2007. I believe this coincided with a major Australian sporting event - the Australian cricket team's tour of India. There also appears to be some annual peaking in the results around September/October. The Australian Football League has it's Grand final around the end of September. There is also a bank holiday in Australia called Labour Day, which takes place in some states on the first Monday of every October. 

Looking at the world trends for cricket, the UK, where the game was invented, does not appear in the top ten.

Wow a lot of suspicion and cynicism here, that's cool though, I just take this as an academic exercise. Therefore, I'm not worried about the veracity of the data, perhaps it's because I'm Colombian and I'm not developed enough to think about it. Anyway, what really interests me is something that might be linked to that underdeveloped way of thinking. I wonder why on earth would someone search for the upcoming year? I haven't even made it through this year, with all its problems and worries, and I'm already thinking about the next? Perhaps, more developed and wealthy humans have evertyhing figured out and need to start thinkig about what's next.

‘.. patterns are only evident if you look at behaviour on a very large scale – a national or an international scale. More than you and I come into contact with on a day to day basis.’ 

This reminds me of a book by James Surowiecki – ‘The Wisdom of Crowds’. Although crowds can on occasion do some incredibly silly things large numbers of people working on a problem and large data sets do often come up with predictions, relationships that are valid. He does provide some statistical justification for his assertions: decisions and predictions with Big Data do not just rest on the beliefs of one or two experts there are a multiplicity of sources on offer from which you can predict the future. On balance Surowiecki would go for the big data approach.

A similar pattern is seen in March. Taken in isolation, these results suggest a landslide victory for UKIP in the election; however they are polling 3rd, well behind the Conservatives and Labour, & due to the first past the post system, will likely win few seats. 

Stripping out the results for UKIP, the most popular search term becomes the SNP, even though they only have candidates in Scotland, with less than 10% of the electorate. In Scotland search trends for the SNP show a big increase in September 2014 - the referendum, and a further increase in March, well ahead of other parties.

Ultimately, that is one of the problems with large data sets...multiple small trends can combine to make a large data trend - now what does that large data trend actually show you?...the unique contributions such as culture, race, demographic, economy, history, internet access(and demographic there of) all combine to produce the overall trend and they are not all constant for all countries.
Similar in the way multiple quantum effects in physics contribute to the planets going around the sun.
If you were to take the the papers overall trend as definitive you could infer that the reason why countries are successful is because they are forward looking however this does not factor in the reason why some countries search for the future...  is it not the case that successful countries need to look to the future to remain successful, or successful countries have the opportunity to look to the future...or do we as humans when we are not successful pine for the past that we see through rose tinted glass?? ....or all of the above.

This would be more efficient than a one-size fits all approach that is currently administered. Nicotine is one example but it could be applicable to medicine in general.

If one plots, say, Y v X and assumes a linear correlation between them, and the best straight line gives a correlation coefficient of around 0.7 to 0.8, (in some of the information presented only 0.5) then it reasonable to assume that with such a large amount of data points, something must be wrong. I would tend to assume that another variable is at play. Of course there is the point that with very large amount of random data, one can try to correlate any two variables relevant to the data.

http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=2013%2C%202015&geo=GB&date=1%2F2014%2012m&cmpt=q&tz=
So it would appear that the UK became less future oriented in 2014 even though it grew richer as a country at a faster rate than any other developed economy. Explain that!
Putting aside this outlier, I quite like Mike Bohmbach's theory of causality: i.e. that richer nations are more future oriented because they have more wealth to devote towards leisure activity such as holidays etc. In fact I would go a step further and suggest that it's not just related to leisure activity, but all economic activity. In other words, richer nations have more advanced economies in which companies and individuals have become more specialised and inter-dependent, and therefore economic activity today requires more detailed future planning and certainty about specific dates and events than it did decades ago when our economy was less advanced and less inter-dependent.",2015-04-25 21:28:34 UTC,,3

* satisfying demand, as people want to measure their health

* a big spooky move to capture health data for health insurance, especially with upcoming funding crises in mind (regardless of the varying economic models we currently have in US and UK).

I find the emphasis on seeing how far you've moved to be a bit crude, as it doesn't capture other forms of exercise, aside from cycling.

-- in cases like these, the request in each case is for the most immediately relevant data, and the date really indicates nothing about the time axis orientation of the requestor, and

addressed before we can really advance,and make use of the data sets.

What exactly is "" Big Data"" and how can we  distinguish it from say "" crowd sourcing data,""or any other form of ""big databases,"" or ""open data."" 

Well for one,the definition of Big Data is constantly evoloving and at this particular moment in history it is very much contextual. Depends on who is collecting the data, the tools they use to collect the data, and the accuracy, predictive power of the data.

From a previous Mooc (the very informative and pioneering Web Science Mooc st Southampton University) I learned that Big Data needed three major components to be classified as such.

The Big D 3; if you like. (Just a personal mnemonic)

Big Data needs to have : 1 Volume,2 Velocity and 3 Veracity (aka "" messey data!"")

However past data contains much more information e.g. monthly variations (more car sales in Spring?) or the effects of a new model coming onto the market.

A lot of data is collected monthly because that is a meaningful period to make sense of trends. It would be useful if the unemployment figures were available early in each succeeding month but, for example, daily unemployment figures would not be very helpful and anyhow economic measures to impact the employment figures take months to have any effect (if any).

Not really surprised that when nonsequel video games are considered based only on critic ratings the correlation between baseline and actual outcomes is so poor.

I think the use of log scales on the revenue graphs clouds the fact that many of the predictions are an order of magnitude wrong. Not sure I would be keen on a model that predicts $1m revenue but only $100,000 is actually made (although the reverse would be a nice surprise). 

Interesting that the combined model for movies seems to be more accurate for large budget productions. I wonder how advertising influences these models especially how broad the time period around the release data is.

Avoidant behaviour – avoiding medical TV programmes, GP appointments and anything else that might trigger the anxiety, and avoiding activities such as exercise that are perceived to make the condition worse.

C.  School searches indicating how popular some schools are likely to be so they schools can review / reconsider admissions policies. And looking at searches associated with school inspections to predict what type of questions teachers might be asked by parents.

Presumably most decisions could be improved by better estimates of future behaviour but I not sure I can think of specific examples at the moment. I feel many of the examples shown so far tend to fall into what I call the “so what” category. i.e. The data shows this – so what?

I hope that the nowcasts are compared with the actual data, in retrospect, as it comes in, in order to verify the nowcast and to improve accuracy in the future.

It strikes me that this might be the big data 'killer' feature, in that it might permit nowcasting to occur faster. I still have reservations that big data is any better at predicting the future than traditional methods.

I also noticed that the Nowcast examples are all tests of binary conditions: People are either unemployed or not, they visit Hong Kong or not, cars are sold or not. A car can't be half-sold. I wonder whether the analysis would be as successful where the condition being tested did not have a binary outcome? Perhaps this is an inherent limitation of big data nowcasting that we ignore at our peril? Big data is shiny and new and is the business buzzword 'du jour'. Perhaps it has a useful part to play, but is not the panacea that is sometimes claimed by some salesmen?

1.	Medical – to monitor a person’s condition in real time and even administer treatment or automatically call for emergency aid as required. 
2.	Location collars for very young children and the old with confusion, both of whom are likely to just wander off.
3.	Technology can be used productively to give aid to the disabled: the blind, those unable to move very far and those with speech problems. I find using a phone a nightmare and the simple text/email is my lifeline.

Putting too much trust or faith in any sensors, or the data they produce, is very dangerous.
A similar assumption of error can be applied to databases that might be used with these sensors. For example, there are many stories of accidents occurring because people unquestioningly followed the instructions of their GPS map devices. 
Security of these devices is almost always overlooked. For example, implanted medical electronics typically have little or no security built into them even as their network connectivity increases. There are researchers who have found ways to remotely trigger pacemakers, insulin pumps, and the like. Scary stuff.

oneover <- 1/num # Take the inverse

They can then either bring in more staff or look at their promotional strategy to boost bookings. By looking at the overall trend of search interest over time they can plot where the business is heading. Similarly if the search term Hotels Dubai is generating double the search interest of Hotels Bangkok, you could infer that the number of bookings in Dubai should be greater because the pool of interest is twice as big.

In the machine world, the chances of another aspect distorting the outcome is far less than in the human data world. We already have big data systems in industry watching millions of events for patterns of failure and sending engineers ahead to replace the part before it fails. Telecomms is just one industry already doing that at scale. The issue is not the system but the belief of users/managers that its correctly analysed a costly part is predicted to fail and therefore letting the system automatically despatch the engineer. Here in the human data world the various comments seem to come down to the same issue. Do we ""believe"" it works. Are we prepare to change our own behaviours to use the insight?

""Nights out in Cardiff around 20 years ago often ended in grim scenes at the A&E of the University Hospital of Wales, not least for Prof Jonathan Shepherd, a surgeon with the job of treating what seemed a steady stream of patients with facial injuries.

Beyond the injury toll lay something surprising when Shepherd and his researchers examined the figures – less than a quarter of the A&E cases treated were recorded by police, largely because victims were fearful of reprisals, were confused about what had happened, or were victims of domestic violence.

Over the following 15 years, the surgeon brought together the police, medical staff and local authorities to pool information on weapons, times and the city’s violent hotspots. The move allowed officers to better focus their energies, with streets pedestrianised and plastic glasses introduced. By 2007, violent incidents had fallen by around 40%, with savings of £7m to the taxpayer that year alone, and Cardiff rank as safer than similar-sized cities.""",2015-04-28 09:45:00 UTC,,31

in different representations and formats.  All these are tasks

to the founder's success (Sir Tim Berger Lee), is that ""Everything 
can be linked to Anything"".  Of course we are not escaping from 
the ""Big Data"" issue,  although be it the main element, and
the main technologies that allow different types of data to
be analyzed and rendered in one single format are RDF,
XML, OWL, SPARQL.  Yet to my surprise, mentors have
not mentioned the WEB 3.0 and its present phase of use,
although there is a big link.  This is where I would say, the

I think assessing search in relation to category is vital here as there is definitely going to be different types of search (and search psychology) related to different areas.  Someone also mentioned the problem of induction elsewhere and i wonder the extent to which an initial search and subsequent searching within the same session are subject to 'nudging' from sponsored links advertising etc.     Whilst being able to build this into the algorithm to fine tune a prediction i think this needs to be understood.  Whilst not a search engine Amazon's model of suggesting other products is a very obvious and helpful facility that is present more subtly in search engines. That however may be an opportunity too i.e. analysing  common jumps/trend from topic to topic.  
On that point we are not talking about stable predicable environments.  Google for instance is a constantly changing environment that changes the way you search and retrieve results that again probably undermines highly accurate predictions;  probably backing up one of the  conclusions  that being limits to the benefit of this sort of data",2015-04-28 19:19:14 UTC,,2

Projections have been around for years (e g Gallup Polls, which tried to predict things like election results, likelihood of buying a new car etc based on asking a sample of people on the street, via telephone and other channels). Such projections were more or less accurate compared to the actual outcome, and the technique was refined over time as the projectors analysed the reasons for inaccuracies and devised ways to reduce those innaccuracies. I'm sure the same thing is happening with projections that use Big Data as (one of) their data sets, and the success of the technique will depend on whether it really does produce more accurate projections. On current results, that seems to be so in many cases, but I have a nagging feeling that success here depends largely on knowing what to look for in the data set.

I agree that judgement (or ethics) is something that we haven't yet taught to machines, if we ever will. I've spent the last twenty years designing decision support systems for financial services and in later years this has included systems that are capable of learning. Even with very sophisticated rules and access to growing amounts of data, they still only excel at basically 'yes/no' questions, unless you want to pay for Watson for each bank. :) Certainly, in the insurance industry deciding whether to accept a risk can be way more complicated for a minority of cases. Thus I don't think that we'll be getting rid of human underwriters in the near future. 

The systems that I designed were there to take the simple 'yes/no' answers away from the human underwriters, and provide timely information to humans when the answers weren't that simple. I recognised that in these cases the machine has limitations. There were people who thought that the system will be a magic bullet and were disappointed when it was not that.

I wonder whether this is the same view that affects 'big data' currently; the 'silver bullet' syndrome?",2015-04-29 09:20:15 UTC,,1

With movies, I assume there generally are one or two spikes that are out of the range of Fig. 2, chart D: The release of the first trailer, and the release of a second trailer/or when the trailers go on to theaters. Modern movies tend to get their first trailers almost 6 months prior to release, and a second trailer within a few months of release.

On games, the chart makes sense as well. Games is about to come out, you want to find a YT-video with some in-game footage to make a decision on whether you want to buy it or not. The hype train is real and game publishers start an aggressive push the closer the release date gets.

Music on the other hand is a fickle mistress, with any number of songs having the potential to go bust or break huge, with a huge factor in the genre and artist in question.

I have been through the FAQ for RCurl in the link you proposed. Very interesting. 
Quote:
So you need to make certain that libcurl is available. Do something like locate libcurl and see if it returns something like libcurl.so in the lines it emits. Alternatively, do locate curl-config and see if it is present. 
Unquote

When I run  locate libcurl I get about 50 lines of output. I guess it is present.

When I run  locate curl-config I get nothing.

Indeed, this is what the original error message was (see earlier post):
checking for curl-config... no
Cannot find curl-config
ERROR: configuration failed for package ‘RCurl’ 

Why do I not have  curl-config and how do I get it?

While watching the video, specifically the photos' example, I couldn't stop thinking that the information presented could be very useful but also must be treated carefully because it could easily lead to false conclusions. 
For example; every country or even region has different relations with the internet. Particularlly, my country's communications infraestructures are really poor and loading and downloading images is not an easy task. So, it could be interpretated that, maybe, people in here are not quite into the social media, which would be completely wrong. 
Then, from this point of view, it seems to me that is difficult to draw broad conclusions regarding actual social behaviors using this kind of data, and that this type of analysis can give accurate information only if it's related with the actual phenomenon measures, for example, numbers of users of some platform.

Earlier during the course you mentioned of a certain research

of researches/statisticians would not be able of that kind of internationalization, therefore you base your work on the Arabic Nos

understands, except the Arabs.  Right and common understanding
achieved so far?  Right?

Now, in session 2.4 you are trying to prove the time gap by employing a symptomatic example of the Hong Kong international tourism
provenance.

French, Japanese, Cambodians, Nigerians, Greeks, etc., in respect of 
events, restaurants, hotels, packages, and everything else that has to do with ""What to do/see while in Hong Kong as a tourist""

The software we have developed @_textient  analyses complaints (text form) and intelligently predicts the behavior . we tell if a customer is happy, frustrated, angry, disgusted. we also predict the context of this meaning what's making them to get frustrated .

Further, we can predict the desires or needs of the customers and we can also predict and segment the persona of the customers.

Pre-empting is possible when its possible to make a forecast (prediction) with enough data of the above. Say if the historical pattern of data  has a lot of negative bias, possibly this can be forecasted and alerted.

Pls. feel free to contact me . I can possibly help .

In last week's example, I think Suzy and Tobias were specifically looking for search terms that could be compared at the international level as individual strings. In the case mentioned in 2.3 (searches for tourism information in Hong Kong), what mattered was being able to establish a correlation between relevant searches from one country (e.g. Germany) and volume of tourism from that country in a given period. For this reason, it was not important to ensure identical or even similar search terms among countries. So I don't see any inconsistency, or rather if the methodology differs, it's because the goal of the research differs.",2015-04-30 07:05:20 UTC,,9

The answer is using a data base (information program/schema),
against Google data.
The subject of tourism is of national interest and such a data base
would readily be available.  Not only that, but it would be built so
that linear fields and text sets would form relationships.
Now, going back to Google, the data is not available (I don't think)
in the form you need it as above.  Meaning various searches with
no specific focus, but, to do with generally, what to do/see while
in Hong Kong as a tourist. Of course, those searches have been conducted in different countries and respective local languages.
Yet, applying Google's tech and data, can you then explain "" how
you would exactly succeed in normalizing the many used languages to a common understanding, just to begin with?

No matter what you wish to call those technologies.
Sophisticated terminologies such as, estimators,
anticipators, collectors, navigators, correctors,
and I can go on and on.  Nevertheless, none of
the above technologies is what surely what one 
should call ""ACTIVATOR"".

Give you an example?  All of the above will simply trigger
an occurrence, within a specific environment, but, none
will take the necessary action  (the activator element
is missing).  In real time, if a fire breaks out, the alarm
will trigger a sound of danger:  And yet, no action at all
will be taken in that to activate the fire extinguisher.

Health monitoring is another use, which is already being performed. It could track vital information of elderly, sick or young people and feed that information to the relevant person not only to alert to any emergencies, but to alleviate the problems of 'snapshot' visits from care professionals.

In a slightly cheekier use, if wearable devices can track your eating habits, you may be able to incentivise things like weight loss. If your device detects you eating chocolate, an automatic donation is made from your bank account to a charity who you do not support or a text message is sent to your significant other who will subsequently berate you.

So concern in the general population is (possibly / probably) associated with investors selling.  Is there quantitative evidence for a tipping point where the level of concern is likely to lead to a crash? For instance, late last year the FTSE dropped by 5% (or more, quite a marked drop, but not so unusual): could I have assessed the level of concern reflected in the previous few weeks' searches and comforted myself that this was only a temporary dip?
Is somebody producing an app that allows investors to predict deep dips and protect themselves - probably making an even bigger impact on those without the app?  Could be frightening having everybody doing semi-automated trading - the markets are volatile enough as it is.  Soon after such an app took hold, the professional traders would be upgrading their systems to start issuing 'jolly concerned' searches on Google and then  short selling just before the app started recommending 'sell' to the general public.

regarding, as you stated, the correlation between 
relevant searches from one country (say Tanganika)  and 
the volume of tourism of that country.  It does not matter,
what the ultimate goal is.  Primarily you should be able to understand the two elements that formulate the correlation/
relationship, i.e. the contextual search relating to the volume
of tourism of the country in question.  So, as you can see I am not referring to identical or otherwise search terms, but, a common
understanding amongst the various countries and different  
spoken languages.  I think, what is really needed here is
""NLP"" (natural language processing), where you cal apply 
AI (artificial intelligence), say, translating, extracting events,
prices,names, production volumes, company values, etc.

What If a fully-sighted man took part in this event?  In other words,
who is more or less brainy and why?
He has also talked of the raw map of the output from the brainwave
handset.  In what form is that output produced?
How and why the said output is wired up to a Bluetooth head set?  
I partly understand why.  In order to achieve voice communication.
But, wiring up something to a wireless device like the mentioned Bluetooth
head set, to me is completely non-electrical and also non-electronical

I finish this article with a greater appreciation of the quality of data between different domains, and the need to have a relationship between search data and structured information - e.g. backing up search data with IMDb to scope by movies, together with use of specialist Yahoo search engine for music. 
It's also very interesting to understand the quality of intention. As observed in the article, searches for different domains have different significance for future event (if you're going to see a film, you're probably going to search for a place to see it). Studies which work to better understand search behaviour and intent, and pick these patterns out, could lead to more successful prediction.

This week there were a lot of headlines generated from the announcement that the UK economy had grown 0.3% in the first quarter of 2015. It was subsequently used in political arguments: a sign of a failed economic policy for some, a success for others.

This article argues that this constant demand for instant data isn't always helpful: http://goo.gl/fLflt1 - in particular, ""Between 1997 and 2014, quarters with an initial estimate of between 0% and 0.5% growth have eventually been revised up by 0.3 percentage points on average. So if the latest quarter matches the norm, our 0.3% bogeyman is looking like a much healthier 0.6%.""

Aside from the author's political point-scoring, the fact that rushed calculations become important in political public discourse shows the need for faster, more accurate data aggregation.

The correlation is clear but takes place within a relatively tight range of values and behaviours. Most countries with a future orientation index greater than one, fall between 1.0 and 1.2. Even at the upper end of this range, countries will be making just 10% more 'future orientated' searches than countries with a balanced past/future value of 1.0.

I don't think that this relatively small future orientation underpins the economic success of more affluent nations. Higher disposable income brings choices for planning future utility and pleasure; things not open to people whose priorities are making ends meet. In addition, greater prosperity drives aspiration for current and future ownership of material goods and experiences, many of which will be researched, sourced using search engines, and purchased using the internet.

This is precisely the point of correlation.

If, most of the time, an increase in searches for BMW of 5% is followed by an increase in sales of BMWs in the following month, then last month's searches are a good predictor for this month's sales—ahead of the actual sales figures.

In reality, (a) not everyone will have access to or use that information and (b) not everyone will respond to the same information in the same way.

Here is an example illustrating this. These days it is very easy to find the cheapest price of just about any object, from a pen of a few cents to a home cinema costing several 1000s of euros/dollars/pounds. You would therefore expect everyone to only buy from the cheapest supplier, and eventually all prices to converge to that lowest value. And yet, it doesn't happen—for precisely the same reasons. Some people don't have access to the information, or cannot be bothered to access it. And even those who do may still decide to not buy at the lowest price - maybe they trust a more expensive vendor more, maybe they ship more quickly, maybe they prefer buying from a real shop.

The point is: different folks, different strokes. ",2015-05-02 19:43:57 UTC,,6

I'm not sure that is how Big Data is generally used. As I think Suzy mentioned, the way Big Data is used is to enhance predictions, not to make them in isolation (or in competition with conventional methods). The connection between Big Data and the (hopefully) enhanced prediction is not normally speculative, but based on evidence of correlation between the Data, and the actual outcome. 
That said, I am sure there have been situations where, despite a strong prior correlation, some other factor has been responsible for a large deviation between prediction and outcome. ",2015-05-02 20:01:41 UTC,,1

I’m pretty sure that we can never have insight into financial systems which are complex systems operating on an international level and are influenced by government actions, company actions, the weather, individual preferences and many other factors. 

We often hear that stock markets do not like surprises or uncertainty e.g. confirmed bad news has little effect on markets because it has already been taken account of. Perhaps it might be possible to construct an uncertainty index of national and international events that maintain or upset the political, financial or military status quo. The index might be correlated to stock market movements. Numbers of searches of online sources for keywords like election, fighting, innovation, revolution etc could be the source data.

Cynics might suggest that better results might be obtained by monitoring those who are attempting to manipulate markets.

By placing inexpensive cameras and sensors in the shelves they could establish what customers are doing, how long they linger before either picking an item, or moving on.

As Mark mentioins, there exists a problem in transmitting data to basic sources, such as,
hospitals, police stations, airline head quarters ,etc.  I personally, maybe everybody else too,

was not detected and consequently avoiding the French Alps disaster.

In business we often take a demographic of customers, split them into two and trial a different approach with one segment and keep the other as a control group - we can therefore measure the impact of our actions by comparing the two groups. In these scenarios, where we're looking at the population on a whole and trying to understand how the increased availablility of information/data can affect actions there are no control groups - so in the instance where the prediction of events leads to a change in behaviour (potentially avoiding a negative outcome) it's difficult to prove the impact given that there is nothing to compare it against.

As a basic eg, if predicting traffic congestion enabled us to alter routes which meant the traffic jam doesn't occur - how do you go about validating the intial prediction given that it never happened?

Similarly, how do we go about understanding the impact that polls in the lead up to the election will have on the way people vote, when the outcome being forecast is in itself changing behaviour and altering the actual outcome...",2015-05-03 13:31:51 UTC,,10

Assuming privacy issues can be addressed, however, the fact that data from wearable technology can be linked to an individual gives the ability to create multi-variable datasets matched at the level of individual observations, rather than looking at, for example, how total searches of a particular type correlate to another aggregate variable.  For example, the UK Biobank (www.ukbiobank.ac.uk) last year issued wrist-worn activity trackers to a sample of participants, and as a result will be able to look at how activity levels relate to a whole range of other data about participants at an individual level, albeit that results are then reported at aggregate level.

There are some studies from biological sciences in which statistically better results were achieved for patients with heart conditions who were prayed for by prayer chains (compared with outcomes in a statistical control group which did not have the sustained prayer efforts). Although the rigorousness of that study has been subjected to criticism by some physicians because of the difficulty of measuring/assessing prayer chain activity, it is my understanding there was a statistically observable result. A lot of anecdotal evidence supports prayers as helpful for the sick.

We can only judge the success of it in those areas where studies have been done and from the lecture that appears to be urban Britain.

Another problem is just because criminals are more likely to commit a crime in certain areas, does not mean they won't commit crimes in others.  So we need to ensure that we make a minimal level of police protection in all areas.

I do however think such analysis are useful, but they need to be repeated over time in each area so that as criminals change strategy, so can police. ",2015-05-04 10:15:51 UTC,,5

Retailers can't find out who their customers are, when they pay by credit card.  If they could identify customers, they could also know exactly what each of these customers was buying.  This would enable targeted advertising communications and deals.  If you came regularly every Friday and then missed a Friday, they could call or e-mail you to offer a special deal and get you back.  If you bought Coke regularly and never Pepsi, they could provide Pepsi coupons.

This failure to acquire information at retail has nothing to do with privacy.  Obviously if you buy at a store the store is entitled to know who you are, and can ask for an ID along with your card.  Even if you purchase on the Internet, the retailer is entitled to obtain identifying information.

The reason retailers don't get cardholder identities from Master Card and Visa goes back to the dawn of the networks in the 1960's.

researchers used millions of mobile phone records to track movements of people in Kenya and then overlayed that data with incidence of Malaria. It allowed them to show how Malaria spreads. You could even, in theory, see people (and warn them via SMS) who were very likely to give or get Malaria. It's useful, rather than just interesting, because donors like the US, spend millions on net campaigns. They could use this map to better target those campaigns. I think it's an interesting example because big data alone (the mobile phone data of how people moved) wasn't enough. You need to combine data sources to tell a compelling and important story. Also, it's not enough to show that there's a relationship- for the relationship to matter you have to very clearly say: a) this is what we can do about it and b) tell decision-makers in way they understand and can act on.

The data shows that at all times since 2004, with one exception, interest in nuclear war has been at least four or five times as high as interest in nuclear accidents worldwide.  The brief exception was in 2011, following the terribly destructive accident in Fukushima, Japan, when, for a few months, there was somewhat more (at most 1.5x) as much concern with accidents as with war.

In Japan, which may feel that it would not suffer in a nuclear war, interest in that subject has been negligible almost throughout--as was attention to accidents prior to Fukushima.  Right after Fukushima for about 8 months, there was also substantial (though less) fear in Japan of nuclear war.  Hits on accident had 4 peaks at times after the initial reaction to Fukushima had lessened, but each of these was less than 1/4 as much as immediately after the accident.

In the US, attention to nuclear war dropped by almost half between 2004 and 2013, with many fluctuations.  After 2013 it has tended to rise--presumably because of Russia's aggressiveness.",2015-05-04 21:09:38 UTC,,3

Would considering selling really prompt more interest that considering buying?

What else might you be able to use such Wikipedia page view data for? One use might be to consider subject matter for an article or a book.

But that's beside the point.  What a business, an advertiser, wants to know is what consumers are looking for, what they THINK they want.  Knowing that, advertising messages can be tailored to attract larger numbers of people.  Once they come, you can try to sell anything related to their search--something different, what they're really willing to buy. 

An example: Let's say people search for ""best online colleges"" or ""highest rated colleges.""  They're not looking on the Internet for ""economical colleges"" or ""lowest-tuition colleges.""   Many of them in fact would be delighted to find an accredited, easy but low-cost online college.  They just aren't willing to search for that, it's not what they THINK they want.  

So then, we have to advertise ""highest rated"" and all those good things.  Once we've got the prospect to click to us, we can transition: We can say ""We're high rated AND ECONOMICAL.

Interesting and maybe contradicting comments.
Do you think that the frequency of google searches regarding crude oil have a bearing on crude oil prices.  Does it mean the more searches the more likely the crude oil commodity will go up; and of course the reverse.

On the other hand, is there a relationship between fuel efficient cars and
oil refining companies?  In my opinion, there is none. 1)  Because oil Cies
want to sell more and more, so fuel efficiency  of cars is not their strong
point at all.  The relationship in this instance stands between automotive
industry and motoring communities.  In other words, the more efficient the car proves to be, the higher sales can then be gained by the motor
manufacturer.

In final analysis, should you still be more interested in the oil companies 
prices manipulation, which, often is false speculation, try the American
oil Co., namely, ""Chevron"".  Their site runs on ""WEB 3.0"" technology, which, in turn means that not ""Big Data"" but ""Linked Data"" is the name

First of all tweets are not ""insider"" anything, they are open to all.  Like a newspaper.  So, once a newspaper or Twitter ""prints"" information available to the public, it's not ""insider"" anything any more, it's available to all and they better not ignore it.  Even if the newspaper got the information from an unauthorized source within the company.

Second, analysts have categorized FB input or tweets as ""positive"" or ""negative"" in their reflection of the mood of the individual.

If on a given day, we have 1000 employees of a company tweeting and 800 of them tweet positively, 100 negatively, we can compare that ratio to former values, and to trends in values for employees of other companies.  If this company has a relatively high ratio of positive tweets, I'd interpret this as a positive signal for the company.

We could also limit the analysis to employees with particular functions or units within the company.

It is the job of a society that cares about these things to collectively construct rules and enforcement to ensure that the proper information is given (in lay-person's language), so that consent can be informed.

Wiping off $6.1 billon from market capitalization of the company. is no mean feat! A possible victim of its own success(velocity) in issuing the data.

So do these companies have a right to keep the data for ever, or will some legislation come in to regulate what can be captured and what can be stored. Plus what happens to the data that's already stored.

I would bet that the majority of the data is ""Hashed"" which would mean that it probably could not be put into a form that the average person would understand.  However with the correct tools the data would be as revealing as a personal magazine on each of us to its owner.

Another really big problem is that data may be acquired globally and also stored in multiple locations. So there is no real point of law that can be applied to the data owners other than that by the strongest Governments eg US or EU in the way of fines against some of the larger companies. But it seems that the data is being also acquired by lots of companies that are obscure to the general public and that these companies are able to ""Trade in the data"" amongst themselves on the fly.

Wonderful discussion by trio.  You mentioned that you have a designing background, i.e. using Photoshop.  I have also taken up Adobe Creative
Suite (Web Design Version #4), with emphasis on Photoshop and also
Dreamweaver.  For me, the Photoshop commands are fairly easy to use,
but difficult to know when to apply them.  They are so artistically
oriented and not easy to distinguish. 
I remember we had a short conversation, about NLP/AI, when dealing with the Hong Kong tourism volume, eminating from different countries.
That was an advanced question, whereas Suzy, is somewhat applying
the philosophy/procedure,as follows:
//  Extract your Big Data
//  Refine/filter Big Data to represent own need
//  Methods to manipulate the refined/filtered BD 
//  Ask your questions within the context of the formated BD 
//  Get answers, as accurate as they can be
//  Examine answers
//  Your decision whether to apply or not.  

The ""R"" programming language is not as simple to learn, even the basic commands, considering the short course study time.  
The course material will remain downloaded for some time, which, is
good for a future back-up.

But reading for gist, I'm impressed by the sheer amount of data analysed. The FT varies from an average of 112,00 words on Tuesdays to 195,000 words on Saturdays. (Note for humanities graduates: that's equivalent to War & Peace every four or five days). And the researcher found a way to analyse five years' worth of newspapers. She matched that against an equally staggering amount of data relating to 31 companies listed in the Dow Jones - their transaction volume and price data. Again on a daily basis for five years. She crunched the numbers and presented the findings.

The larger and more well-used sources seem to have the potential to be more vague in the intent of the person doing the search. This is where contextual analysis would come in. It's in the nature of human natural language to subconsciously use contextual analysis to determine the meaning of an utterance (sorry Chomsky!). This is insanely difficult for machines to do. A 'wicked' problem, as the cool kids say.

I suspect that Suzy, Tobias et al. used the FT because most terms used are likely to have a financial context (although not all, as Greg points out). This reduces the scope of the reference words to be the meaning that isn't financial. They could have used the WSJ instead.

I would think that the sort of analytics that Google use and probably the trading algorithms too, have some form of machine contextual analysis to determine whether the appropriate meaning has been used.

One can enhance the model by adding budgets, who is acting, etc and see if the predictions get better.

a normal sequence of events;  and yet selling/losing  a butch of its
profitable arm (PCD), the IBM market value grew beyond predictability.
Now, can we have an explanation to this, perhaps , using plain English
instead of rhetorics, semantic paradigms, etc. Simplicity is the answer.

This ignores costs such as trading costs and taxes of course. Lets say there were 20 buys/sells per year at say $15 commission over the 7 years. Thats over $4000. So you would need to be committing significant money to the strategy to make it work - and thats ignoring capital gains taxes!

If the aim is to prevent crime then a police presence in one area may prompt criminals to move i.e. a feedback effect. A police presence in an area might also lead to the detection of other crimes e.g. drunkenness, uninsured/untaxed vehicles, carrying of offensives weapons (especially with an increase in stop and search) - however this would be a feedback effect too. There might be an increase in friction between police and the local community perhaps leading to street disorder. Not mentioned so far is the link between drug addiction and burglary/robbery crimes – a good starting point for identifying crime areas may be those where there are the most arrests for drug dealing.
When predicting likely crime areas people think of crimes like burglary, robbery, theft from cars which impact most directly on individuals.

It may be come to pass that search data may get regulated and it will no longer be available to the public or even commercially or it may get outlawed entirely. 
If Google followed their famous 'Do No Evil' policy they would never have started collecting and storing the search data in the first place. Now that they have, the genie is out of the bottle as Google have realised the huge commercial value of all this data.
I suspect that as Google gets more and more powerful the search business, and how the data is handled, will get heavily regulated.

For example, if the question was 'How do I drive from Dublin to Cork' the answer might be 'So, you take the M50 motorway and the exit on to the N7 etc...'

I thought at first this might be to do with the programme 'Friends' as the word 'so' was often used by the characters as an 'intensifier' (e.g. 'thats so lame', 'I’m so not doing that')

I had assumed that is what is being done here. The index is a proxy for the  'general movement in the market' and the return is measured against this index.
But in fact what we want to do is get a positive return whether the market goes up or down in fact and thus do better than the market. So if the index goes up by 1% in a week we should get 1% return. Likewise if it drops by 1% in the week we attempt to get a return of 1% in the week. 
Thus if the strategy works over a two week period where the index increases by 2% in the first week and decreases by 1% in the second week, the strategy aims to get a return of 3% for the two weeks which 2% better than the market movement for the two weeks. 
In this example, the absolute return and the return compared to the market differ which I assume would be typical.",2015-05-07 11:11:30 UTC,,1

Human behaviours that are easier or more straightforward to predict are those for which some sort of routine or pattern can be identified. The weather also has routine to it. When it is April in the UK we might expect the average temperature to be warmer than in March and experience intermittent showers of rain.  We could deduce this from data by analysing historical records of temperature and rainfall at a location and come up with averages and ranges or typical ‘climates’ experienced at different times of the year.  Similarly, predicting human behaviour ‘climates’ from big data could be done by looking at historical data (if available) – where behaviours follow some sort of identified routine. 
However, predicting human behaviour and predicting weather accurately are both complex problems.  To accurately predict outcomes we would need to consider and input all the factors which would have an effect.  Weather forecasts are made using complex mathematical models which have a range of observational data sets of affecting attributes as inputs.  I would think a similar approach for human behaviour is not feasible!

Predicting human behavior can be similarly based on past actions as we’ve seen in the Google and Wikipedia studies relating to stock investor activity. In a narrower view, patterns of behavior can be ascertained: what one did yesterday will probably be repeated today and tomorrow.

In both instances however, what can’t be predicted are unexpected events which can affect both the weather and human behavior, upsetting our forecasts.

There’s no variation in sampling frame; what results do i.e. other financial newspapers, dd/mm/yyyy, etc? I ask as statistical significance between 31 and 30 companies is undiscussed and I’m keen to know of any relationship with Unconscious Transference (UT) and is that on view in Figs 2 and 6 results. Furthermore, are they predictive/independent variables? UT is a forensic psychology term, whereby a third party shows an image to a person who then chooses that image above a selection of others of which they are not forced to select an image from because the image has become subconsciously familiar. FutureLearn Forensic Psychology provide detailed explanation with collaboration of GMP. Your findings may show there is/is not, demographic classification differences concerning UT. The Spearman’s Rank Correlation is quite weak. It is in Quarter (Q) 4=0-0.49˙, where Q1=1-1.5, Q2=1.49˙-1, Q3=-0.99˙-0.5 though does show natural order of categorical variable ‘bank’.

Such data is likely to be proprietary as an entity but I suspect we may see paid for access to this data in the future in the form of structured searches.

My problem is this: Say a researcher is looking for a particular group of persons eg people who might want to by a particular high end car. They run the search and get 5000 users who have intensively researched the car - the database owner could sell their contact details. Another scenario might be that the database owner receives a national security letter to forcing them to  conduct a particular search for the Government and are then legally required to divulge the contact details.

I can expect certain batsmen to score, but a mistake can be made and a batsman can make a rash decision and get run out, a bowler can have a brilliant moment or whatever. 
Similarly, an expected result can be obtained in sport... but not always, as something might go wrong.

I agree with Bobby Chan below, predicting the weather is not like predicting human behaviour. 

I've designed several complex computer systems that are in production and attempt to cope with the whole range of human responses (short of hitting the thing with a bat!). In nearly all cases, the object of the 'intelligence' was to drive the outcomes to one or more binary conclusions. Computers like binary, humans are able to cope with uncertainty; perhaps this is where the gulf lies?

I work in data and, following yesterday's shock UK General Election results, I'm having an existential crisis about forecasting in general! 

What appears to have happened is that all the behavioural forecasts published prior to the UK election (around 91 forecasts, or opinion polls as they're called) were ALL wrong, and wrong by a considerable margin. The only forecast that was anywhere near correct was the one that occurred AFTER voting had taken place.

Thus my question is whether we can trust ""a priori"" forecasting at all any more, or would there have been a better way of gauging voter sentiment ahead of the election? 

Would any search results analysis combined with the opinion polls have predicted the result better than opinion polls on their own?

Is it the case that opinion polls aren't using the right data to predict voting patterns any more and need to use big data more in their modelling?

My worry is that the pollsters being SO incorrect with the UK election results will potentially taint behavioural forecasting in the coming months/years.",2015-05-09 04:39:52 UTC,,25

In Module 3.11, the findings in the paper below correlate with module 3.10 results however, the illustration of those results is different i.e. box plot and dispersion graphs. The meaning is the same but the visual display is different and because I do not know the correct term, I am referring to that difference as ‘visual semantics’ which may be understood by people differently due to their learning styles. Other modules use dot plots and ranking. Therefore, I wonder whether visual semantics illustrate themselves as causation resulting in a confounding increase/decrease probability of behaviour.

I wondered whether this highlights the limits of using search data to predict the views of an entire population when there may be generational differences in voting.

As it has progressed it seems that the  ""secret"" is identifying the primary driver for a particular change; but which mankind is still searching for. 

The stock market is an interesting example because there is already so much data, available electronically, that many users rely on automated systems to buy and sell. But what data do they use to make these decisions? I suspect that many rely on the chartist theories but there will be others using other sources, including Google.  So do the latter create their own changes in prices?

Perhaps the best outcome for me from this course is to help me identify potential sources and  causal relationships so that the forecasting can utilise better ""nowcasts"" rather than data several months or even years old.

Making a subset of these words (think back to the 98 words mentioned in an earlier lecture) suffers from the subjectivity of the people that chose the subset and probably worse still is that the subset is just too small to be significant.

There is no understanding that ""apple"" is a fruit or a technology/life-style company, or that bank is the side of a river or a financial instutute. But the word is found within a context (of other words) and therefore a relationship exists between these words. Instead of using individual words for comparison, use a context.

I wonder if the differences in accuracy between the polls before and after voting relates to how/where these polls are conducted? 

As we have a 'first past the post' system in place and the exit polls are typically conducted outside polling stations it is presumably possible to predict the number of votes in each constituency and therefore predict which candidate/party will take each seat. However, if the polls prior to the election don't take which constituency the voter comes from into account they can only give a prediction of the number of votes for each party nationally. I was looking at an article today which explored what the election result might have looked like if we used PR (proportional representation) and it doesn't seem to differ too greatly from the polls prior to the election.

Daniel, who was awarded the Nobel prize for Economics, addresses the psychology of decision-making and explains the concepts of Association and Availability (the ease with which your mind can retrieve information).  In one extreme example he says ""A plane crash that attracts media coverage will temporarily alter your feelings about the safety of flying....[but] the risk hasn't really changed"".  In this case the report creates a psychological association which modifies behaviour.
Applying these principles to media reports on a specific company could have a conscious or unconscious influence on a stock trader's buying / selling patterns.  Something which is in the news may get more mental 'attention' than companies which have received less recent publicity.

With human behaviour there can be an almost endless list of factors influencing decisions and ultimately everyone is slightly different and could simply act on a whim or a gut feeling.

I imagine that certain areas of human behaviour can be more easily predicted than others, e.g. times and places when there will be high volumes of traffic, where there are 'concrete' factors which the individual cannot readily change (locations of roads, schools & workplaces, working hours, holidays, alternative methods of transport etc). Here there will be regular patterns in traffic volume which can lead to accurate predictions.

With other human decisions, such as making purchases, going on holiday, voting etc, it might be much harder to determine what influences and data are most relevant when making predictions.

This is one of those leading questions that most people react to, just see the responses below, in a predictable fashion; because it is implied that being harder is a 'given', its taken as fact that it is true.

I would suggest that in a lot of cases its not harder at all, in fact its easier. But just like predicting rainfall within 10 square miles within a 12 hour period, 8 weeks in advance is next to impossible in a changeable area like the UK, so too is predicting _some_ quanta of collective human behaviour, we just like to extrapolate that to _all_ human behaviour. No one wants to think that they are predictable; under some circumstance some people will behave irrationally and against their own interests in an attempt to be unpredictable, and in a lot cases people will obfuscate their intended behaviour. Generally speaking though people are predictable; ask those who design supermarkets, or those who devise advertising campaigns, or poker players, or confidence tricksters or magicians.

Various people have mentioned that the criminals will become aware that the police are concentrating on certain areas so they will move to other areas. I also consider that there is a risk that the criminals will change from committing from type of crime to other types of crime and the police will not be prepared for this.

The 'curly' question (I like you phraseology) is, I think, a genuine threat to liberty. We're already seeing the start of this with police using their powers to 'stop and search' disproportionately on young black men.

I think where I was going with my second thought was something along the lines of a self-fulfilling prophecy for crime statistics. If you're looking for something in a certain place you're likely to find it there and perhaps not spot it so much elsewhere. Acting on further analysis would then perpetuate this. For example, data analysis might highlight which roads people tend to speed on. If you then focus resources on catching speeding drivers on those roads (and use fewer resources in other areas), then you'll catch more people speeding there and fewer elsewhere.

Your question helped me organise my own thoughts about this issue.  At the moment, I am writing the methodology section of a research project and have been wondering how to use the data that I am collecting. I can conclude that the initial phase is important when we visualise the objective or the question that we want to answer.  If we do not have an objective, we could end up with high amounts of useless data.  Often, we hear that data by itself is meaningless, and I agree.  The way we analyse and interpret it, is what makes it meaningful.  This is achievable through the use of systems or programs such as Excel that gives you visual images of the data you have collected and entered into a spreadsheet, for example.  Being able to see your data in a graph changes your perception and makes you able to interpret it and to even make predictions--in this way data becomes meaningful.

Businesses might be interested in looking at searches to pinpoint when there might be a gap in a market - or an opportunity they hadn't thought of. For instance, if there is an increase in people searching for online courses in data analysis (due to a need to upskill, or due to general interest in the topic from datablogs they've read for instance) then a university, or a company with strong knowledge in the area may decide to run a course to fulfill the demand that the increased searches for this term are showing. :-)

When interest rates rise many investors sell or trade their higher risk stocks for government based securities (e.g. bonds) which then allows investors to take advantage of the higher rates they typically yield – protecting their investment.

Exchange rates have a direct impact on the price and value of stocks in foreign countries, and such changes also increase or decrease the cost of doing business in a country.  What I think is interesting (and would require different data sources) is that where long-term movement in exchange rates are affected by market forces (supply and demand), short-term movements are driven by news, events and futures trading – and are therefore difficult to predict – just look at our election!

I think these forecasting failures have something to do with Dawkins’ selfish gene idea. When most people are selfish or altruistic it is best to be ‘in the pack’ and adopt the same strategy and so people will generally say they will vote in a similar distribution pattern to the forecasts. 

However the polling booth is not exactly the same as the prisoners’ dilemma. In the prisoners’ dilemma the choices are evenly balanced between selfishness and altruism. In the polling booth most individuals are not disabled, sick or unemployed and don’t anticipate being so and therefore they see less of a downside in being selfish and vote accordingly.

So my own forecast is when opinion polls are indecisive the outcome will be a swing towards selfishness but where the forecasts are firm (as they were in Scotland) the forecasts will be met.

I'm not sure the election forecasts were 'behavioural' (other than in the sense that voting involves actually moving the tip of a pencil :-)). There are many reasons why the polls were not robust - not least that the response rate of telephone polls is typically no higher than 30%, so samples always have a high degree of self-selection bias. There are ways to compensate for this, but they're also not particularly robust. The other big problem is that they rely on self-reporting. You've probably heard the phrase shy UKIP voters (and indeed shy Tory voters) - i.e. people whose intention is to vote for a party, but who don't reveal this to the pollster.

I think some polls looked at the constituency level (Ashcroft), but even there you rely on self-reporting, sampling bias and such like. In the polls there is also never a figure published for non-voters - that's typically a third of the electorate.

I image simple cause-and-effect behaviours are easier to predict than those with more complex influences and outcomes.  The weather is complex but models have been built that are based on predicable scientific factors, e.g. warm fronts against cold fronts results in rain, low pressure against high pressure results in wind!  I can see the only similarities between predicting human and weather futures is the complexity of the models.

* It's all well-and-good predicting crime, but you still have to have sufficient police to detect and apprehend suspects. Cut the police too much and prediction won't help.
* Like CCTV, it could just move the crime to different areas. It doesn't lessen it, it just shuffles it around.
* The Internet just broadcasts your location and activity. Thus more data is available for the crims to lower their risk of getting caught too. The current unsecured nature of the IOT makes this easier.
* What crime are we attempting to reduce? Physical crime? What about electronic crime? People get put out about having their flat-screen nicked, but don't seem too bothered about their pension fund being raided wholesale. £500 vs. £Billions? One happens quickly, the other over a long period of time.

1. The largest possible sample size.
2. The accuracy of the data we use.

Using online data as the collective intelligence factor has the drawback that people is unpredictable. As you have already seen. If I search for the flu, my search not necessarily imply that I have the flu or some relative of mine has it. For example, if kids at school have to write about the flu, probably you will have a large amount of searches for the term in that area, but no one has the flu.

The only things I can think of to mitigate the problem are:
1. Increase the sample size.

The analysis is interesting though in identifying, from an urban planning point of view, where potential vulnerabilities might be (although of course you could see those directly anyway from the actual crime stats) and take preventive measures in those areas (e.g. CCTV, better street lighting etc).

I also don't see why this is ""Big data"".

Last century in many factories and offices around the world they had time clerks who manually recorded all activities in the work environment. The activities of these people had benefits for some and risks for others. Their function was really data recording. The result of which was to potentially change the work environment either for the better or worse depending on whether you were the one being monitored. Other forms of data collecting such as responses to a new product launch were also very visible. This visibility led often to resistance in supplying the information or the validity of the information supplied. It took a long time (relatively speaking) to record this data and find patterns in it that were useful for making business decisions. 
This has changed to a large extent. Technology has moved the collection of data dealing directly with people such as in the time clerk's role and made it invisible to the originator of the data.

I think companies are completely aware that their data is an asset now that can be used to create profit, for strategic planning, for forensic audits, for management, for creating efficiencies... Most have no idea how to go about leveraging the value of that asset though. There is a maturity curve for analytics and companies range from immature to advanced maturity along a continuum. Most are already doing analytics in some fashion, in isolated silos throughout their companies, led by people with some expertise but they aren't doing this in any coordinated way. More mature companies pool their data talent into centres of excellence,give them the keys to their data kingdoms AND act on insights. 
I guess most companies either have the vision and are data-driven or see other companies that are data-driven and they want to be there before they miss that train. If everyone else is getting more efficient or better at business because of data, you ignore analytics and Big Data at your own peril. As with most technology-driven changes in business, people in charge only have to understand that something is valuable and relevant and then hire the expertise to manage it.

b. Security for large events like football matches, concerts - could big data identify pressure points in stadium or theatre structures that need re-designing to minimise the need for police numbers. For example, standards for width of doorways, stairwells, ventilation, lighting, building materials. Potential pitfall: None that I can think of. 
 c. Domestic violence - Could big data be used to predict when domestic violence spikes? Eg.,family profile (family history, unemployment); times of the year (holidays, summer, winter, etc); times of the day (morning, evening)?

Add emotions, which can change a person's mood and heavily influence their actions and the extraneous influence of others, then future behaviour becomes almost impossible to predict.

It really depends on so many different things, and can be quite location-specific, that the weather service can only offer probabilities of something happening. They can very rarely be absolutely sure. Collective human behaviour is also difficult to predict in many cases, especially where spontaneity is concerned. For example, one could predict human behaviour if one new something drastic was going to happen - e.g. a tornado was going to hit a particular place - people would evacuate or find shelter, or there was a strong likelihood of a heavy snowfall for a period of time. - people would rush to the supermarket and stock up on food and drink. Or, given that the next iPhone was going to be available on a particular date, one would expect there to be a queue outside the Apple store. If there was a genuine sale on EasyJet for flights to Rome, one could imagine many people deciding to book tickets to Rome, or at least try to book tickets. The list is endless.

If you didn't have food, what would you do? Would you steal it, would you seek help to get it? Would you allow yourself to starve? If you didn't have shelter, what would you do? Would you sleep on the streets, would you try to move in with someone? Situations can cause people to respond but people respond differently. Someone would rather steal then ask anyone for food. Someone else would rather live on the streets then to seek a helping hand. Pride gets in the way in these cases.  People are unpredictable and behavior is unpredictable as well. It all depends on the persons moral and values. No one knows what goes through someone else's head. A good movie that is an explain is trading places with Eddie Murphy. There was a bet that if Eddie who played a homeless guy and the rich guy traded places, Eddie would fail and the rich guy would lose his mind.

Climate is reasonably constant and fits a set pattern whereas the individual weather patterns have too many variables. Climate will give us a much broader view of what is likely to happen but is not too specific.. This can also be applied to human behaviour. For instance, general buying patterns on Amazon will give us a pretty good overview of demand for product areas (and may even predict fashion trends). Individual buying behaviour is more erratic even when the Herd factor is added. Again, general economic conditions would give us some  predictive thoughts on likely stockmarket outcomes. The trouble is investors are already making their own predictions and investing in the market on their expectation. Nevertheless, Individual company performance is much more difficult to predict because there is more risk in the stock and more volatility which makes for more unpredictable outcomes. Human behaviour is inconstant. Faced with the same information two people can make two different decisions with two different outcomes. Mass movement may give us some general ideas.

My reply is that despite an everyday heuristic reasoning, the past does not repeat itself, from a strict scientific view.

To put it ""simply"" (?) ""You can't cross the same river twice because the water is always flowing"" (imputed to Heraclitus of Ephesus, c. 535 BC – 475 BC). All changes, nothing is static.

To be more complicated (!) the value and the interpretation of an apparent ""past"" event is a mental-cultural construction. Correlation is not causality.

 ""Consider Hume's favorite example: our belief that the sun will rise tomorrow. Clearly, this is a matter of fact; it rests on our conviction that each sunrise is an effect caused by the rotation of the earth. But our belief in that causal relation is based on past observations, and our confidence that it will continue tomorrow cannot be justified by reference to the past. So we have no rational basis for believing that the sun will rise tomorrow. Yet we do believe it!"" http://www.philosophypages.com/hy/4t.htm

caveat is that there is still no single path 2 big data or data science. You certainly don't need to get all of the skills under your belt 2 work in field. a top data scientists said that the best way 2 get into the field is 2 just start doing it. Like RStudio, there are lots of free tools available & lots of datasets. Even if you only have excel or Google sheets you can get started. Ask & answer a question using data. Look at something that means something 2 you & dig into it. Use your local council data, health stats, the Guardian data section... Extract the data you need, analyse and explore the data, determine how 2 format the result in such a way as 2 tell the story that answers your question. Rinse, lather, repeat until you are comfortable doing that process.

Such big data solutions can enable the targeted deployment of expensive and scarce police resources.  Further, crime prevention measures can be introduced or increased to combat ‘problem areas’ allowing police levels to return to normality over time.  Less crime means a safer society, a cheaper legal system (not so many crimes to investigate and trials to be had), and more confidence in the police.  The risks with such an approach is that specific areas could feel over-policed which could raise community tensions or that a small group of individuals distort the data – we have all heard of one-man (or woman) crime waves!  Typically crime is a symptom of a wider community problem and sometimes the police will need to work with the local government to resolve high crime – this is not always available in such models.  Finally, many more crimes are being committed online (or supported by online activity, e.g. selling stolen goods on ebay) and as a consequence the police will need different big data analysis tools and different skills.",2015-05-14 15:53:43 UTC,,4

I was unable to locate KDE. So I watched the excellent YouTube video to attain the research details. Porta et al (2007) has KDE as standing for Kernal Density Elimination, utilising it as a tool. Their paper discusses ‘through traffic’ and of ‘passenger and freight trips’. Therefore, I wonder what the differences visualise as for walking and cycling and if there is any correlation to the ‘climate change sustainability trends’. In other words, have infrastructure alterations, such as transforming UK old railway lines in to walking/cycling routes. Altered patent theory Betweeness patterns and aggregation.

Crime can occur for so many reasons, poverty, drugs, greed, mental instability etc. Some criminals act alone, some in groups, some are drug abusers, others alcoholics, many are neither. Some criminals commit crime in their local area, others travel by car, or public transport, sometimes long distances. Some offences are committed online, many have national and international aspects. Many offences target other criminals. Some criminals can be rehabilitated, some can't. Crime can be displaced and therefore pop up elsewhere.

The network approach, is not protected (is open). On balance, the general population has to contain the brightest, which is no criticism of the police. Just as in a game of chess. The brighter opponent is almost always going to win.

The network approach using big data, would need to be operationally tested (e.g. with the Met police), and this will take resource away from policing duties.

Failure modes have not been addressed, and just as in the example of in vehicle satellite navigation, there will be many cases where a liability will be caused, and users of such systems become subject to public criticism and ridicule. This could breathe new life into the newspapers.

This used to be common in electricity supply, anticipating when all the kettles would go on during the commercial break of a big TV draw like the World Cup. That was in response to predictable behaviours, based on historical patterns, so I guess a similar process applies. But, this examples probably starts with a presumed causal relationship that if there's a commercial break, people will make tea, using the kettle; albeit one that's supported by empirical evidence.

This immediacy seems more common in the commercial, particularly retail sector.

Some time ago I was involved with a public demonstration that monitored various physical signs of stress response in classical musicians. Unfortunately they were only rigged up during performance, but when I was interviewing them afterwards, all (who were highly trained and experienced as performers) reported the greatest periods of stress being either beforehand, or while being publicly interviewed.

In the beginning of (computer) time, early programmers using an old programming  language called FORTRAN made a big mistake. (Rather, it was the designers of FORTRAN who made the mistake)

They used '=' to represent assignment '<-' of a value to a variable. For the operation of equality, they were forced to use  "" .EQ. '

In spite of many attempts with some later languages to correct this mistake, the bad habit of using '=' continues in most widely used languages.

So, if  '='  is already used, how to we represent equality? The simplest answer seems to be to use  '=='.

The opportunistic crimes cannot be easily predicted because they are not really planned.

The simpler the underlying dynamics, the more successful our modelling is likely to be even when we don't know what lies beneath.

The best computers now always beat the best humans at games of chess. However the same is not true of poker.

When optimising a system you need to measure something and see whether changes you make cause it to go up or down.

Is not the same question as. How can I most effectively use the resources of the police department to protect the public and provide justice. Do we weight different crimes? For example do we want better detection and prevention for sexual and physical assaults as a priority over acquisitive crime? That's a moral question. The current British society says yes, 200 years ago the answer was no.
One of the problems with academic research is that it tells you what you could do, not what you should do. I could put CCTV in a location where public nuisance crime is occurring.

They are there for people who don't spend all day every day looking after their shares. (I.e. not day traders). If a significant event occurs, such as the rumour of financial instability at a company, the share price can change dramatically. If you don't have a stop loss in place you can find that you have lost almost all of your money by the time you find out about it. The key is to look at the trading price variability of the stock and set a stop loss that will protect you if the stock moves outside that range. If your stock has a distribution of daily price changes in the -2% to +2% region for the past year with intraday ranges of up to +/-5%, you might consider putting a stop loss at 10% below current market price. That is unlikely to be triggered by normal variations (although still possible, you can do the maths to find out how often) but only on a significant news event.

I guess its power stems from the underlying (hypothesis of) a process that leads to unrest, namely the emergent organization of people around a single cause. The mathematics and the model are aligned - and that's when you can really start predicting properly.
For earthquakes there would need to be a similar physical process that leads up to the shock, and for which there are indicators that can be observed. Part of the problem there is that we probably don't know what amount of tension can be built up in the tectonics way below before there is a catastrophic movement, and/or that we cannot directly measure that tension. The timescales at which these events develop are quite large, so predicting the exact year, let alone the month or the day when another Big One will hit San Francisco, or when Vesuvius will erupt again, is very hard. And unfortunately while earthquakes feature aftershocks that occur within days or weeks, they don't typically feature 'beforeshocks' that could alert us of something much worse to come.

However, even with so much data if the activity trackers say the elderly walk 10.,000 steps but the questionnaires says the elderly population is not so active then the analysis from the questionnaire trumps the big data from a non-standardised activity tracker.

This includes the fact the model existing will not change behaviour. But the reality is, the existence of the model itself can change behaviour.  For example if we come up with a perfect model for predicting stock market behaviour, people will use it, but in people using it, it is likely to change the behaviour of stock markets to a new pattern that the model is not set up for.  

Including nowcasting can help as it can see current changes, but the problem is determining what the appropriate time frame to include in nowcasting should be.  Too long and it may not be very different from forecasts without them.  Too short, and it might miss out on important trend changes.  

The biggest problem is you will never know how good your model is until the real data comes out, and by then its really too late.

You can get pigeons to do that and, I believe I read once that goldfish (a quasi red herring perhaps) have been shown to have that capability too. What it doesn't show is that apes have a reasoning capacity - I.e. the ability to select a sequence of buttons which corresponds to a problem to be solved.

I agree that for more complex analysis then exception coding may be required but I'd still maintain that for 90% of the types of analysis that may be required a structured front end should be possible.

You need something to extract data from the unstructured format in which it may be held on the internet; then something to parse it into a structured format; then something to analyse structured data - which could even be Excel (or a GIS,for example, for the crime hotspotting).

Can R export data in a standard file format to be used by a spreadsheet say?

There is some evidence that many waverers decided at the last minute that the threat of a Labour SNP 'grouping' was too risky.

The other point is that the results in the number of seats exaggerated the error in the polls.

As for a 'right wing bias', no, I can't agree with you on that. The examples chosen seem (to me at least) to have been chosen as been understandable and accessible to the majority of students, nothing more. Data collection is simply part of our society these days. The trick is how to understand what it being collected, how it can be analyzed and used, and especially the limitations of the data and the analysis. Knowing that, an informed citizen is in a better position to demand access to, or even limitations on, the data being collected. The democratization of data, if you will.

1. It  relies on self-diagnosis and most of us are not qualified to make such a diagnosis. 
2. People only search diseases that are familiar to them. They can't search what they don't know or what they can't name.  
3. Some diseases have so many disparate symptoms (eg Lyme disease) that you need a skilled professional or a test to accurately identify the problem. 
4. Some allowance has to be made for false positives and for false negatives. 
5. Research on the net may be driven by hypochondria and fear. It does not mean that searchers actually have symptoms or will have them. 
6. If you don't have access to the internet, nowcasting doesn't work. The outbreak of Ebola in 2014/2015 could not have been predicted by nowcasting because the majority of the people of Sierra Leone, Liberia, etc., were too poor to have access to the net. Also, people were so quickly incapacitated by the disease that neither the,y nor their relatives would have had time to conduct research into symptoms. ",2015-05-19 04:40:46 UTC,,16

Big data would be very useful for tracking (place and time) and predicting diseases that arise from the environment - eg oil spills; radiation- Chernobyl, Fukushima.
It may also expand understanding of diseases like multiple sclerosis, for which an accurate medical model does not yet exist. Understandings gained from big data could change the way we define disease.

She was dismayed at their slow response time. Thousands of people died in the 3 countries affected, but the spread of the disease to first world countries was averted. The Ebola example showed that predictive models can work very well, but resourcing is an issue. The disease spread quickly through unsealed borders and air travel. Adequate and timely medical team resources were not made available. The hospitals and staff belatedly provided was too slow and came too late. The vaccinations that were eventually developed could not be adequately trialled or deployed in enough numbers to help the medics (let alone the people) on the front line. If this is the look of future epidemics, we desperately need predictive analysis and emergency health resources that can be posted quickly wherever they are needed.

2.

It has even reached the stage where our 'happiness' or wellbeing can be estimated and then sold to others to target us with products or other offerings.

Also, although the underlying data sources are large, once they have been filtered then the resulting structured data is much smaller (I'm guessing).  For example if you are looking at the correlation of a stock price to a search term then you'd have two variables - the number of occurrences of a search term in a day, say, and the closing stock price.  Trending it over 5 years say would give you about 2000 records.  That sort of volume would be easily held in Excel.  If you wanted to create a larger structured database, e.g including all stock prices and all possible search terms then I'd agree that Excel would have problems but I'd argue that in an analytical process you'd probably start simple and do some judicious filtering to begin with.",2015-05-19 11:56:42 UTC,,0

I venture to guess that nearly all those in the medical field dealing directly with patients, at least in modern countries, have access to the Internet. In the U.S., physicians are being directed to digitize their medical records so the doctor or nurse is using a laptop or tablet to write case histories and are even able to order prescriptions online while meeting with the patient. Lab reports are easily shared online. (Immense privacy implications…l know.)

If these methods can help resources be deployed efficiently and effectively with less, than more power to it.

That said, the presence of heavy policing can be antagonistic in some situations. Any decisions based on this analysis would require an understanding of relations between the police force and the community. I suspect this data would be more qualitative rather than quantitative, and so would require combining data sets.

This analysis also focuses on actions perpetrated by the public - I wonder if it allows for those actions by police that provoke a spike from the community, such as the recent events in South Carolina with Michael Slager (although I hope that these are anomalies).

That is, perpetrators need to have become aware of potential (stationery) targets, in order to revisit them. This might (or might not) explain the lower correlation of car thefts with betweenness. But for opportunistic crimes (as opposed to those happening in opportunity spaces), it's probably harder to predict.

I find myself curious about the stories beneath the data, such as what motivates particular crimes. So, poverty and an urgent need for food might suggest crime targets nearest where the criminal lives. Or, low education and career expectations might make crime seem like the best income from a given social position, balanced against the risk of being caught, as a perfectly rational decision.

While these are useful hypotheses, to be tested with data, there's the risk that this puts 'hard facts' behind preconceptions and reinforces them more strongly, as we've seen with league tables and notions of ""sink estates"" and ""failing schools.""

So, deciding to meet in pubs rather than gentlemen's clubs might at one time been considered 'underground.' But I'm sure that's been pretty much characteristic of any resistance or guerilla warfare: it's about finding the blind spots in your opponent's mindset. So, if you're trying to find the needle in the haystack (and you assume competently-organised underground protesters), the 'magnet' is probably an awareness of your own blind spots.

Hospitals (and other emergency services) have contingency plans for critical incidents including epidemics, major accidents, large-scale terrorist attacks etc. It is not cost-effective to have resources simply on standby for a serious incident and even if prior warning of a problem is given it is unlikely that additional infrastructure can be created at short notice.

The functions printf, fprintf and sprintf come from the language C. Other languages have adopted these functions and have kept them the same which makes life a little easier when you switch from one language to another.
The specifiers (the single letter after the %) are reasonable intuitive.
	c: character (a single letter, digit or symbol)
	s: string (of characters)
	d: decimal integer
	f: floating point number
Above you saw the use of extra formatting information between the ""%"" and the specifier, that is, ""%02d"" will make sure the resulting string is at least two characters long by padding with leading zeroes if necessary. Use ""%2d"" to have blank space used as the padding (handy for lining things in columns). You can also use ""%.3f"" so that a float like 3.14159265 gets formatted as ""3.142"".

Confidence should be one of the easier things we can glean from analysing search queries - the language people use, and the patterns of trades seen previously on stock in which we knew investors had either high confidence or low confidence.

On the other hand, conventional wisdom is you cannot consistently beat the market legally. Prices are based on up to date information - if you here a company has had good results, and want to buy, the price you see has already been inflated by analysts to factor in that good news. You could beat them by luck (buying just before price increases) or from inside information (illegally), but could not repeat these wins over the long term. 

The other thing to note - not all stock market activity is trading (short term). Players buy, sell, lend, and borrow for investing, diversifying their activity and risk management too.

One issue with this is that with too much learning on the baseline and generated interdependence between the variables, the model may end up being exceptionally good at predicting the historic curve but miss future events that evolve in a way that the model has not seen before.

This is particularly important in climate science where modelling and being able to link to physical data in areas without direct sensing is problematic. e.g. http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/10/5/054017/article

But, if the bugler is not attacking randomly, the police best move is to focus it's resources where the  bugler is acting, until it ceases this behavior, when the police should turn back to equalizing the bugler chances.

On the other hand, if the police fails to focus on high reward areas, the bugler best move is to act on areas with high reward and low policing. But that behavior will cease as soon as the police realizes that this area has high risk and act upon it.

There isn't enough space here to describe all the analysis or include graphs but you can see it on my blog:  http://spiritofgreen.tumblr.com/post/119713189176/measuring-engagement-of-e-learning. This also gives a comparison between the Big Data course and an earlier Climate Change course.

Main conclusions are:
1. There is a model which can measure the level of engagement on a course, using the number of comments per session as a proxy for engagement
2. An Engagement Attrition Index has been derived. This shows a high attrition rate for the Big Data course and a low one for the Climate Change course.
3. The EAI can be a very useful statistic for measuring how effective a particular course is.  It can also be used to compare between courses to see how improvements could be made to courses with high EAI

Big Data is in the field of data analysis, which involves statistics. That alone (as everthing with math involved) may drive many people off. In this course the hard part seems to be R. R is heavily used by data analysis professionals, and not one serious course on big data analysis would adopt excel as main tool. There are other MOOC on data analysis, and they all tend to use or R or python.

It may be that the EAI coefficient is related to the course difficulty, then it may not tell you so much about effectiveness.

One may lower the EAI coefficient by simply making the course too easy. But then, what's the point? Then the course would be limited to explain what big data is, but would not give you the chance to work with big data, which is much more interesting.

By the way, the climate change course only explain what climate change is, it doesn't have students doing climate changes projections. If it had, it EAI would increase.

As I said at the beginning of the analysis, there could be many reasons why one course has higher attrition than another and that would be an obvious area for further research. You're right that 'Big Data' could be intrinsically harder than 'Climate Change' (personally I don't think so!). But easy courses could have high attrition too because they could be boring!

 The point of the Engagement Attrition Index though is that it could be used as a common measure for courses and therefore is one tool for evaluating 'performance' of courses in the broadest sense. In that sense it's very similar to the Big Data analyses presented in the first weeks of the course which were identifying patterns based on correlation, without giving the underlying causes, just hypotheses.

Re Big Data one possible hypothesis for the higher attrition could be that the course wasn't described accurately. It wasn't billed as a course in R and indeed the original description even said that you didn't need to do any of the work in R to follow the course.

It's maybe the case that on this course so far, we've focused on using programming constructs to manipulate file layout, meaning a fair bit of typing in order to change round the layout of data. It just means that we haven't yet seen R showcased to show off its full power.

A key observation made when comparing with Microsoft Excel is how Excel is limited to an extended 1 million rows, whereas R is only bounded by how much memory a computer contains.

A recent survey related to financial data analysis showed one analytics firm had R as only one of the tools in its armoury. Most data was curated and used specialist databases and algorithms.

I think that the more sources that you can use to confirm your suspicions, then the more confident you can be that deliberate manipulation of the data is unlikely.

Today's government decisions are highly bias prone. Economic decisions, traffic decisions, many are based on personal views, opinions and feelings. But, if everyone suddenly has access to forecasting, a government will not have how to deviate from the optimal path.

For example, suppose everybody can tell, with click of a button, that the economy will react badly to a 1% increase in taxes. If then, the government decides to increase taxes anyway, it will be called stupid. It can resist at first, but not for long.

A two sample paired Wilcoxon-signed rank test is the approach used. That approach is a correlation-ranking test to identify independent population relationship as a number, for example, 0.04 identifies no relationship whereas 0.95 identifies a relationship using variance. It is a nonparametric test based on descriptive and inferential statistics [1] as opposed to independent sample t-tests with probability and standard deviation [2]. Advantages of using a two sample paired Wilcoxon-signed rank test approach is they provide a narrow range of ‘answers’ [3] i.e. ‘yes’ and ‘no’. Therefore, because no additional analysis occurs results is in a shorter time. Because of the simplicity, the cost is relatively cheap [1] which is effective. A wide spectrum of information is used and whereby anomalies and outliers do not adversely affect the outcome [3] enabling greater nowcasting accuracy.

2. Search terms (words) do not always show the intent of the user.
3. Stories in the popular media made lead to artificial spikes in the search term.
4. Even though English is widely spoken, the same English word may have different meanings in different parts of the world. E.g. 'Jumper' UK = pullover jersey, US = type of woman's dress
5. The reverse is true, some parts of the English-speaking world have different words for the same thing. E.g. 'Grill' = 'Barbecue' = 'Braai', 'Pavement' = 'Road', 'Pavement' = 'Sidewalk'
6. Search terms may change quickly over time. Young people use 'sick' as a term to express 'good'
7. People that searched for flu symptoms, may not actually present to their doctor. Having read that there is little that can be done by a GP (physician) They may not go to see them and therefore not be reported to the CDC.",2015-05-26 09:30:43 UTC,,28

The fact that the model showed its inability to adapt to changing search behaviour amongst the population was obviously an important lesson to come out of this research.

Your first sentence sums it up, the management and funding needs to be addressed first, but I think that big data could go further than disease prediction. You also point out that there is a GP shortage that is likely to get worse. That's because the pipeline for training new GP's is low and getting lower. Perhaps data analysis could identify potential shortages in medical staff and plan for the next period (five to ten years) to make sure that shortage is reduced. Sure, disease and illness planning is useful, but if there aren't the doctors, nurses and support staff to put any of this planning into action, then it all counts for nought.

I think that big data and data analysis can help with the whole gamut of public healthcare including:

1. Planning for disease outbreak and illness progression
2. Drug and treatment efficacy
3. Staff resourcing and training for future staffing requirements
4. Stock planning with respect to the amount of medicines likely to be needed
5. Continuous analysis of the efficacy of treatment outcomes
6. Research into new forms of treatment
7. Flexible use of the existing facilities
8. Effectiveness of funding (vs. outcomes)

My background is pre-Internet information management, so I tend to think in terms of databases, datasets and how many records these have as a measure of size; others might consider the aggregated numbers like we're seeing from Google or Wikipedia as data. A single piece of video could be both a single 'record', and also a massive volume of bytes. In human terms, I suppose the video could represent hugely subtle and complex information such as character, plot, nuances of image, light and framing, sonic information etc. I could certainly see this as big data, but probably more of an unstructured nature than what we've been looking at so far.

But, to turn this on its head, what we've looked at so far is data that's created by collecting the actions of big populations.

Circling around the question of video:

Tagged video - tags can be analysed.
Streamed video - data stored on consumers' equipped can be analysed (to improve the service)
- providers need to catalogue, categorise, store and retrieve ondemand in response to sudden bursts of consumer requests and spin up multiple streams on a large scale.
- billing triggers and marketing 
- network providers have to manage data flow, bottlenecks, throttling back, prioritise response times of mixed data e.g. Voice (Quality of Service QoS)

Video production libraries probably  already contain a data commentary.

News channels are subdivided into short news stories e.g. Post UK General Election as Prime Ministers speech, opposition party leader resignations given a rich vein of consumer/voter demands.

One way to consider this is to jump outside the box and picture a research fellow at Warwick University playing around with R and Google data and identifies a strange correlation that showed a link between the number of people searching the term ‘clown’ with the number of flu cases reported (bear with me, assume they were bored one afternoon).  
After much checking they showed this to Suzy, who was a bit sceptical at first, but agreed with the findings.  Nobody could work out why there was this correlation, but this went on to became a key tool for the Centre of Communicable Disease.  In other words, if there is a consistent correlation over time, and it predicts real world events, who cares.  
In the flu case study, the correlation does not have to be linked to the actual number of cases of flu in the real world, it is just that for whatever reason, the quantity of searches goes up and down in line with the number of cases of flu.

If the medical authorities were forewarned of an upcoming epidemic, steps could be taken to prevent spreading the disease by limiting access to/from the affected area for example. This proved effective in the recent Ebola outbreak and to a lesser extent during the H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 2009.

Influenza infections are normally treated with antivirals and antibiotics. If an outbreak were predicted, health authorities could stock up on these drugs beforehand. Face masks could be ordered and decisions made about closing public facilities should it become warranted to limit exposure.

History records numerous examples of epidemics and pandemics. It’s estimated 50—100 million people died from the 1918 Spanish flu. It’s probably safe to say that there will be more such events.

Demands on health resources might be more related to beliefs than actuality. If a lot of people are searching for flu-related information, it might still be a good predictor of demands on GPs, regardless of actual cases. The search behaviours might be 'wrong' in relation to actual cases of flu, but 'right' in terms of people's current preoccupations and how those impact public services.

I was interested to see that Google Trends relates news stories to the data being analysed. While initially interesting, I also became sceptical, partly as some of the news sources seemed relatively 'minor' but also whether the news reported the behaviour being shown in the stats, or caused it. But there's clearly self-awareness at Google about the relationship between mass communication and mass behaviours.

Perhaps harder is where the mass communication is peer-to-peer (e.g. social media). While we could adjust for flu scares through known, authorised news channels, this might be harder where the chatter is off the radar.

Rather than treating individual cases as non-urgent, then pressing the panic button once 'epidemic' is called, might this lead the way to a more fluid and responsive way of managing? That is, might direct access to very current data lead to health organisations having to be run in a much more agile fashion? Would public money be available to support such pre-emptive health, or is it just the nature of health policy that an epidemic is a necessary tool for loosening the political purse-strings?

2) Once someone has researched flu symptoms, they have that knowledge and so are unlikely to search again for the same information. So, the first year may be much closer in terms of predictions, but after that some part of the general population would be more educated and so not need to search on Google. Would that explain the discrepancies in Google trends for flu? 
3) I think it would be more instructive to search for Google trends in illnesses that are ""rare"" rather than the flu, which most people know about. We might see tighter trends there.",2015-05-28 15:11:00 UTC,,0

If we could interconnect some type of reporting system that was accessible to health workers/officials around the world, and there were ways to enter the data about actual illnesses treated in the population, AND it was don almost real-time, then we could have a very powerful system for predicting what might happen next.

allViewsData <- allViewsData[order(allViewsData$Views),]

This puts them in ascending order of views and clearly the peak date is March 18. I see others on here have done the same sort of things.

A frightening thought is that in future people who take steps to ensure that little of the personal information is released might come under suspicion as having something to hide.

I agree most people would say that this is flawed, but that is because they are thinking in a small-data frame of mind (not a criticism) and as we all were taught, a correlation is not necessarily because of a cause/effect relationship and should be treated with caution.   However, the question being raised by big data is whether we can (or should) change our mindset to one where correlations from big data can be accepted as useful indicators without fully understanding the reasons them?

Further, ‘nowcasting’ models will always generate errors eventually.  Models by their very nature cannot model the non-repeatable, and Human Beings or specifically why they search for what they search for are non-repeatable.

Look at how long it took to get computing on the syllabus and for them to adopt open document standards. I'm glad that they have, but it's a symptom of a bigger problem.

Industry very often speaks of efficiency, but where people are concerned, effectiveness is a better measure. I can have a CRM system that is extremely efficient, but doesn't actually deliver any benefit to customers; quite the reverse. Alternatively, I could have a very effective CRM system that fulfils customers' needs and results in a lot of repeat business.

The current dogma here in the UK has consistently seen public institutions as better being run like a business for maximum efficiency, when surely delivering effectiveness is the key? Sure, profligacy is not an effective strategy, but I think that better results could be achieved by being effective. Early diagnosis and treatment, for example, could reduce long-term costs by getting people back to productivity much sooner than fire-fighting when things become serious.

But one more thing to come out of this: benchmarking does not have to be profitability or commercial measures. It could be frequency measures of successful early interventions, or negligent misdiagnosis.
I don't want to be hard on GPs - many are fine and doing a very tough job. But even in a small circle of close family members, friends, flatmates etc there are more than a few cases of serious illnesses that were missed - the indigestion that was found out two years later to be a tumour, the cistic fibrosis missed for 17 years (it appeared milder than for most who have it, but all the symptoms were present, caused ongoing problems and clearly matched the illness).

How many of us feel comfortable to go back and report a GP for missing things?
I probably wouldn't, and most people I know didn't. But then nothing improves. If measuring relevant things, and reliably so, it can shine a light on issues and reveal a gold mine of information not previously known about.

Discrimination or common sense?
Pension companies have had to change recently due to legislation, where they now cannot ""discriminate"" on the basis of gender when determining pension pot.
My opinion is this is madness. It has been proven and accepted for years that women generally live longer, so they traditionally received a slightly smaller annual payment on that basis. Now they have to get the same. 
It was not discrimination, it was insight and basically factual...I am a male, but it affects/will effect my mother, wife and daughter so that is not the reason for this rant.

My understanding was this: If you create a model based on all available historical data (as the Atlanta/Google flu team did) then you don't allow for changes in search behaviour over time. E.g. do people search in the same way now as they did in 2010? The static model this creates does not allow for this. The Warwick team's findings are that there is benefit in taking a shorter timescale of data on which to base any model.  Therefore the models are adaptive and change each time you make a prediction.,2015-05-30 09:27:40 UTC,,2

In my view it doesn't matter who is included, and/or for what reason. What matters is the correlation between the searches and some other outcome. If that is robust - in the sense that it systematically improves predictions - then it is useful. 

Imagine you could observe the lunchtime restaurants of a couple of companies in a town, and count how many people are coughing. If you find that an increase in the number of coughers correlates with higher incidence in flu in the whole town next week, then it doesn't matter that you're not observing schools,  municipal offices or care homes, or that some people may be coughing because they've just choked on a piece of carrot.

Many more people will be looking for information on flu when people in their vicinity, or they themselves are becoming ill. 

But even that doesn't matter: the only thing that matters is the systematic correlation. If for some reason a drop in the people searching for Bart Simpson correlates with an increase in flu cases in the next couple of weeks, we may of course be deeply mystified as to why that is the case.

-The only answer is: education !

3.      Should the rules be different for scientists?
-  No ! That would be a terrible world. Same rules etc for all of us. Who is a scientist?

I think, it is very necessary to distinguish / differentiate between moral and ethics. This is the reason why I can not accept question 1 and question 2 as / in the way or form they are put here.

The following article might give some insight to the quest: http://mashable.com/2011/03/16/rebecca-black-youtube/
Rebecca Black's song (Friday) was launched on 10-Feb-2011 with little interest until 11-Mar-2011 when Michael Nelson tweeted to his 19,000 followers that it might be the worst video ever.  Subsequently, Youtube views went viral.

As an aside, I re-ran the R scripts replacing the search term ""Friday"" with ""Rebecca"", but there was no noteworthy peak in Mar-11 that could be linked to the song.  I guess this is a case where the name of the song is more memorable that the artist.

Nobody is suggesting that Google searches are the only source of information to help identify imminent epidemics. The point of Big Data is that it *may* provide insights that would otherwise go unnoticed. Statistics will help determine whether searches for certain terms increase the accuracy of predictions on the incidence of flu. If they do, great - if they don't, let's move on to something else. A priori objections about the elderly not using the internet etc don't matter per se.
Even if the internet were only used by 20-30 year-olds and by nobody else, and if that age range was only 10% as likely to contract flu as all other ages, their searches could still be very relevant to help predict a flu epidemic affecting the whole population.

There's allot of let's say 'skimming' money off of each trade every day, when you apply it to vast sums, it soon adds up.

The same approach but with traffic would help better plans for roadworks infrastructure.

Businesses can better test new concepts or products or services by monitoring people's interest in  lifestyle. For example, I searched 'vegan', 'pescetarian' and 'vegetarian' - the 1st overtakes the 3rd in 2011 while the 2nd is hardly sought. Could cross-reference it against sales of fruits/vegetables and also of fish/shellfish? Would that help in promotion a new chain of fish restaurants?

Or alternatively you could search fish recipes, meat recipes, vegetarian recipes and vegan recipes against sales of raw prodcuts like fish, meat, fruits, vegetable, dairy, etc. I did this search just now and it looks fish recipes are searched more - probably because people do not know how to cook it compared to meat and veg!

“They say that Richard Cory Owns one-half of this whole town
With political connections to spread his wealth around
Born into society, a banker’s only child
He had everything a man could want
Power, grace and style…

The papers print his picture almost everywhere he goes
Richard Cory at the opera, Richard Cory at a show
And the rumor of his party and the orgies on his yacht!
Oh, he surely must be happy with everything he’s got…

He freely gave to charity, he had the common touch
And they were grateful for his patronage and they thanked him very
much

“Richard Cory went home last night and put a bullet through his
head” ",2015-06-01 21:11:41 UTC,,6

The moral is - you cannot easily create more of something overnight without lowering standards.

The British census is one example where personal information can be obtained from published big data. After a census ( last one 2011 ) the Government publishes anonymous data about each district. A census district is about 150 homes. The data is totals like how many have cars, cancer or Christianity in each district. If a researcher knows one rare fact about a home ( eg the home has a swimming pool ), then the total number of homes with a pool will be one. The researcher can compose questions like "" how many homes have pool=yes and cancer=yes ?, always hoping for a total of 1 or 0. So software using sophisticated maths can deduce all the answers on the census form. The size of a district made this impossible when the census was designed, but now powerful PCs make it possible.

Take cookies for example - legislation to allow for opting out has led to websites simply not functioning unless the user opts in. In any case someone somewhere will always be on your digital trail.

Back-testing is sort of like In Sample. While it is okay to use In Sample that to gather information you need to test your model using Out of Sample.

""Traders who are eager to try a trading idea in a live market often make the mistake of relying entirely on backtesting results to determine whether the system will be profitable. While backtesting can provide traders with valuable information, it is often misleading and it is only one part of the evaluation process. Out-of-sample testing and forward performance testing provide further confirmation regarding a system's effectiveness, and can show a system's true colors, before real cash is on the line.

Though in fairness, it seems like the academic publishing and peer review process also fell short by failing to question the study's rigour in that respect.

I'm not sure that making the research finding publicly available *as well as* in academic journals is any more of a justification. There seems to be a current move toward making academic research more widely available and - particularly where the research has been publicly-funded in the first place - it seems that inquisitive taxpayers should expect no less.

But the key thing seems to be that any research that breaks the rules can potentially source much richer data than research based on standard ethical principles.

What seems relevant is research standards and authority. The publisher's authority legitimises what they publish, but stems from the standards they demand of submissions, and the PNAS disclaimer suggests a cock-up in accepting the FB research for publication.

But should we demolish the bastions of academic authority? Personally I don't think so. We already have a plural publishing sphere, where low-end newspapers can re-hash cheap press release surveys, and anyone can publish wholly uninformed opinion in a blog. But each of these is its own arena, so to enter academic competition without following the same rules seems wrong.

But, even if not authoritative, it may still be useful. Like the Google Flu/CDC question, it may have practical merit, even if it's not rigorous.",2015-06-02 22:27:49 UTC,,1

Theoretically replacing Facebook pages with graffiti, it is unnecessary to give contributors opt out options where contributor anonymity is secured thus preventing harm to individuals. Legal definitions of harm include financial and mental (defamation with and without intent), and physical (with and without intent). Actual harm is measured by impact and the temporal severity of that impact (http://thelawdictionary.org/article/how-do-you-prove-a-defamation-of-character-claim/ ), therefore recovery is more than ‘happiness’.

I also find the potential for wearable technology to monitor internal bodily activities (such as blood sugar levels) very interesting, as well as the ability for such technology to predict when people may be suffering from depression (as discussed in a previous video).  Perhaps wearable technology could also measure stress levels or monitor your attention while performing certain tasks in order to improve an individual's well being and/or efficiency.

In regards to broader public uses, I think wearable technology can also contribute to urban planning. For instance, a device's GPS system could track the most popular cycle routes around a city, particularly during rush hours. This could potentially lead to city planners developing projects to ease traffic congestion and improve safety in busy cycling areas. ",2015-06-03 14:30:47 UTC,,4

For example, Tampa is experiencing an increased urbanization while trying to make the city healthier, more pedestrian friendly, and supporting the drive for professional growth.  Using a time pattern analysis over lapping with other data sources like traffic, census, and other data can establish whether or not urban planning is working.  This can even identify areas that have improved versus decreased.  City developments that I believe contribute to the overall happiness are lavish and improved multi-purpose walkways, the Tampa Bay Lightening going to the Stanley Cup, the owner of the Lightening being actively engaged in downtown development, and several other developments that make this city significantly better than what it used to be.

For example, public policy decisions that are based on big data analyses risk excluding people who don't contribute to the data, such as those who pay by cash, or who interact directly with people rather than via machines. So, over time, such people could become marginalised, simply because they're invisible to the analyses. Of course that could argue that contributing data is as much a democratic obligation as voting.

One 'small data' example, an analysis that I've often considered developing, might be a sort of 'fairness index.' That is, in any given sphere (such as MPs, journalists or company boards), how proportionately different groups are represented relative to the population as a whole. So, that could be by gender, ethnicity, education/class, age or ability. The danger of this indicator is that it risks fuelling arguments about which group is worse off, which could be counter-productive to achieving fairer representation in all aspects.

Data containing bias can be beneficial and non-beneficial to society. For example, a societal community may have increased happiness where Kramer and colleagues Facebook-type is undertaken therefore providing an in sample analysis. In 2004 to 2014 theft increased from 78.6 to 86.7 and motoring offences 78.0 to 86.8 (Conviction Tables). For example, an online game provided to prison clients may reduce the number of indictable theft offences and summary motoring offences yet increase theoretical incidents. This may provide the illusion of happiness, a hedonic happiness whilst the activity continues. However when now-casting, upon release of those when the activity discontinues out of sample, harm may occur to that societal community as there is bias in the in sample because it is based on contributors of the activity only. It is clear there is need for a holistic sample to narrow the bias in the out of sample.

It was more around the culture of various sectors, rather than simply the legal framework. That is, I guess academic/research work is deeply process-oriented, so it matters a lot *how* you go about doing something, such as ethics and methodology. And that goes deep, so I can still remember my school maths teacher insisting I show my working. On the other hand, the business model of the last few decades has probably tended to be more goal-oriented, focused on profits and share price. But, as you say, the climate may be changing, so integrity, values and collaboration might be coming back to the business agenda, which could make the idea that they follow common standards more feasible.

I guess accountancy is one area where a standardised, proper process has prevailed within the business environment, and indeed seems to be one of the few practices that's easily transferable between sectors.

If I subscribe to Facebook, even if I don't pay, I expect that my wall reflects exactly what it is supposed to reflect. I don't expect Facebook to start filtering the messages from my friends that should appear.

At one end of the continuum it seems to be of little consequence, no more of an issue of somebody spotting you out shopping in the town centre on a Saturday.  At the other end, it gets obviously scary (and wrong) for example. a controlling regime spying on its citizens.  The difficulty is first knowing where the boundary is between the two and secondly, knowing what you can do to stop people crossing that boundary.  
I don't have the answer, but a first step is educating people about the benefits and risks of sharing data and the potential transparency of the data that they give away. People have to take some responsibility. But, as others have pointed out, individuals will need to rely on others putting systems in place to control the use of this information. 
I lean towards the view that the benefits outweigh the risks, and anyway,the cat is out of the bag and there's no going back.  However, I am - and after watching this video, will remain - cautious about what information I put online.

As a long-standing participant in the Mappiness experiment, the value to me has not been so much the knowledge that on average people are happier in the weekends than at work, but the trends in my own personal reported happiness. If I find that, over a long period of time, I report being happier outdoors than indoors, then that is a useful insight to me personally. It's my ""personal"" Big Data that provides me with that insight.
There are also policy insights that can be drawn from the aggregated data, though - I think George obliquely referred to for example the fact that lots of people are happy when they walk through the woods, which could be used to build a case against steps that reduce access to woodland. Likewise, if it turns out that getting stuck in traffic is particularly detrimental to people's happiness, this might spur the authorities to take congestion-reducing measures.

Since the Situation Analysis needs to be carried out very quickly, “OCHA is open to using new sources—including social media communications—to augment the information that they and partner organizations so desperately need in the first days of the immediate post-impact period. As these organizations work to assess needs and distribute aid, social media data can potentially provide evidence in greater numbers than what individuals and small teams are able to collect on their own.""",2015-06-04 11:38:32 UTC,,1

Scientific research and companies improving their services with data is not a bad thing and needs to happen.

Interestingly, Google M asks to approve each category of permissions the first time the app tries to access that feature of your phone (http://goo.gl/rx48Pd). Perhaps this is one way.

In some studies assessing pain in animals in veterinary hospitals, an area that was once deemed quite subjective to study, spot surveys were conducted and humans used a checklist of signs of animal pain to assess responses with a high measure of success, apparently. That effort produced a lot of advances in veterinary medicine. It may be that many areas once considered very subjective and somewhat removed from objective evaluation will soon be able to be studied more effectively.

For example  fluoride is put in our water and its just assumed thats ok and there are liitle black boxes counting cars on our roads. There are experiments going on around us that we havent consented to take part in all the time. For me the important thing to consider is how invasive the experiment is. For example counting cars is pretty non invasive its not going to affect the driver or passengers or passers by but manipulating peoples emotions is rather invasive and like has been mentioned already if someone has mental health problems it could destabilise them. ,2015-06-08 00:46:16 UTC,,0

5678473,ed3d6607-1be0-4f1b-b204-063560959fb6,,7.5,7,5,I think big data could be used not just to measure happiness per se but try to break down what makes people happy. It is true that this is different fro every human being that we all have different things that make us happy but if we could somehow break the population up into different groups according to their age sex marital status children income etc and then test if they are happy gardening studying socialising etc then we might gain some insight into what activities make different groups of people happy. Im sure lots of research has been done on this already but has it been done on big data? . I also think with regards to treatment of me tal health problems poverty can be an issue and actually there are things that would improve peoples quality of life and hence their happiness but it can be difficult affording them. For example i love studying and the fact that these moocs are free is an absolute lifesaver for me but i would love to do an msc but cant afford the fees. And i really struggle with keeping my house clean and tidy but again it costs money to pay a cleaner.

Also for me having things like a haircut and my legs waxed can be hard to afford and these things affect my self esteem  and actually if i had a budget set aside for such things it would help me justify having them.

If she had real flu she wouldn't be playing tennis. In the UK 'flu' is too often used to describe even the lightest cold, this sort of broadcasting by national media only reinforces the idea that 'flu' is nothing serious. So the point I've been making throughout is that we simply mustn't just jump on any data and take it immediately at face value but should consider how it might also be or have been misinterpreted and therefore to what extent we might need to ask further questions before jumping to conclusions. I agree with Koen that Big Data may provide insights that other data may not provide, but my problem is that there are a lot of people here and on other forums with very little statistical background or understanding who are jumping too quickly on the most superficial stats, sometimes through ignorance, sometimes manipulatively, and that is potentially dangerous.

And does there need to be a known event for this to estimate numbers, or could it work where people are gathering for an unknown reason, such as a secretly-planned protest?

I'm also curious about 'intra-event' communications, such as calls/messages or Twitter conversations between people at the event, and whether that offers any correlation; or whether people watching it on TV might equally be joining in, which could muddy the sample.",2015-06-08 23:12:02 UTC,,0

As people become more aware that the cost of 'free' services is their data, I wonder whether we might start seeing a sort of 'data inflation.' That is, rather than simply using any app that's free, people might be more demanding about what they're getting in return for their data.

So, for example, Tobias' example that people might get information on local restaurants seems like a very poor incentive, and I suspect most people (or maybe it's just me) would assume those were the restaurants that had paid for advertising, rather than an objective information source. A printed event programme that includes adverts seems reasonable, so if they're providing the same information through an app, there's no more added value to justify the data cost.

The idea that the app could use the same crowd location data that it's harvesting, to actually help the crowd manage itself, might be a more valuable incentive.

Model:  Ln(comments)= 8.19 – 0.33*#weeks.

The newspapers project their strong opinions, and present stories in a way that presents their viewpoints best. We saw this during the elections when some stories made the headlines on certain newspapers and not others.
We are constantly bombarded with messages which bring out the consumer in us. Advertisements, offers, glamorous posters, etc. Nobody blinks an eyelid because everyone ""knows"" that it is advertising. 
Several years back, the TV channels were sending ""subliminal"" messages in their broadcasts, where an image would show up and disappear before the person watching could actually ""see"" it. They found that the message got through to the viewers' brains even though they did not consciously register the message. This activity was supposedly stopped.

5) Safety
6) Material wealth
7) What is going on around them

Some of these can be changed, and some are much harder to influence. So, for example, if all the newspapers and TV channels only presented new stories in a positive light, that would suddenly start making people more optimistic. Today, it seems that the more violent or gory the story, the more coverage it gets in the media. That causes fear and concern. 
If people stayed healthy and fit, their happiness would probably improve. If people were paid enough and had comfortable places to stay, and felt secure, their happiness would probably increase.
So, more research needed and a way to use the results of research to improve the well-being of the population.

I'm reminded of going to Trafalgar Square for New Year many years ago, feeling it was a sort of 'word on the street' event, and surprised to discover a huge row of ambulances waiting nearby. Because, of course, it was a well-known event, even if never formally organised.

I suppose you can build a picture of happiness by following the example of blind men who when introduced to just one part of an elephant, state that it's skin it tough, it has a truck, and it's big.  There are lot of ""blind"" spots in that description.  Here's the Stratfor definition based on the Anna Karenina principle for family happiness:
""Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina begins with one of the most famous lines in literature: ""Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."" According to this idea, to be happy, a family has to solve a large number of complex and interconnected problems — ranging from the management of money to coping with adultery — and not fail to deal with any of them. This concept gave birth to the ""Anna Karenina principle,"" which dictates that a deficiency in any one of a number of factors dooms an endeavor to failure, or simply; ""unhappiness."" ""

""Happiness is something that comes and goes. It is about excitement, fun, moments, actions, and material things. Contentment is something that lasts. It's about going with the flow, enjoying the satisfaction of work, and appreciating nature and life. Selfish people tend to strive for happiness and are less content. People who strive to be content tend to be more patient, caring, and happier. You can find happiness in money, pleasure, and doing what you want. You can find contentment in religion, family, giving, making other people happy, hard work, education, and exercise. Also, when you are content, your happy times are happier and your sadness is less sad. Self-indulgence makes you happy. Sacrifice makes you content.""  Per this definition, happiness comes from without and contentment comes from within.  I like the spice of happiness, but I'm contented with contentment.

Overall, I believe big data offers the possibility of improved life in our cities. For example, where data shows congestion alternative routes given via signage, traffic lights, and communications media in relatively real-time. Where congestion continues that data may be useable as evidence for land planning proposals which aim to shorten journey times, therefore assisting personal time management, drainage where flood reoccurs, and where animals cross roads but cause congestion. The data may also show tapped people in locations who fall victim to climate change phenomena and who need rescuing.

I do not remember the exact figure but it was a surprisingly high percentage. Let's guess it was 50% - in other words that the average car on the average journey would use only half of the space of a traditional owner driven vehicle. Also add the fact that the cars would be in use for a far larger % of the time (as they are only rented). This could lead to huge savings in road building and carbon emissions (although the number of journeys might increase as they become cheaper and quicker).

In relation to big data and its uses and the moral quandaries that are often mentioned in these comment streams, I am making this point. Sometimes the benefits of new technology are so overwhelming that we have to overcome our reluctance to surrender some freedoms in order to implement them.

Also, time of day is relevant, some routes are not at all busy at night, impossible in the rush hours.

The segment choice points are usually major junctions or involve some sort of ""pinch-point"" (e.g. a bridge) which may or may not be blocked.

The pricing method of the taxi company may also need to be considered, do they charge a fixed price for a journey or a meter price for example? Differences in routes for each direction will be influenced by one-way systems and avoiding right-hand turns. Also the postal districts used from the data to map routes are large so initial route selection may depend on which parts of the district are actually the start/end points.

The spike in FLikr photos mirrored the event here but it is a big leap to suggest that you could estimate the scale of future disasters by the volume of Flikr photos. These events are by their nature relatively rare (so there are limited amounts of data to collect). As mentioned below the data is further skewed by the wealth of those affected (and disasters disproportionately affect the very poor), only those who are not seriously injured (or dead) are able to take part, the network is likely to be overloaded or otherwise affected by the disaster.

* This might be more measurable if there were a geographic 'hole' in the centre of the data, caused by inability to upload photos.

150 million - the number of sensors deployed in the Large Hadron Collider at Cern, Switzerland
1 PetaByte (1 Million Megabytes)  - amount of data generated by these sensors EVERY SECOND
6 Gigabytes per second - of the 1PB of data generated per second, the amount that is stored
35,000 - number of servers needed to store the data

So I think that we're going to need have have loads of sensors in order to detect the tiniest of anomalies as early as possible. If we don't have enough sensors, teh data may be too sparse and we may not detect the danger signals until it's too late.",2015-06-14 14:17:08 UTC,,5

I suspect that most people don't keep an entire map of a long journey in their heads, while handling complex tasks (driving). They get to the landmark (waypoint) and load the next part of the map to their concious fore-brain; somewhat similar to a computer loading the next part of a large program from cache. Reaching the waypoint also confirms to them that their navigation is correct so far.

It strikes me that Tobias' earlier talk on using an adaptive model to conduct analysis would be of benefit here. Rather than analyse the whole ""shooting match"" using one model, it might be more instructive to re-apply the model over parts of the journey with some new optimisations.

The only difference between the ""Big"" and previous data sources is the breadth of subjects available and the potential for correlation between data and its source, for example, between the searcher and their geographic location.  

The important thing that seems to be forgotten is the modelling process:
1/ Think about what you wish to model
2/ Propose a model
3/ Test the model; does it work today?  Where possible use historical information to see if the model holds up in relation to the past.
4/ Identify (and admit to yourself that there are) errors
5/ Think about where the errors come from
6/ Change the model
7/ Test the model 
8/ Continue at 4

While development in a city like Bristol seems to be exciting, I too worry that society will become more homogenised and controlled and that individual freedoms will be sacrificed. There will be a blind pursuit of what we can reveal with big data analysis and little thought about the implications until they're actually happening.

What also worries me is that society will be too geared to help the maximum number of people and tough luck to you if you happen to be an 'outlier' on the ends of the bell curve or regression line. Getting help in these circumstances will be difficult at best, actively harmful at worst. In the striving for 'efficiency' we will not be 'effective' where people are concerned. Ultimately, people are not a bunch of statistics.

I also worry that it might create a permanent 'underclass' (ugh, I hate that word) that don't have access to the technology that can get them help and lift them into mainstream society. This will create a set of people that are permanently technologically
disenfranchised, in extreme hardship with no way of improving their situation. We're seeing this begin with public services moving on-line.",2015-06-16 08:48:21 UTC,,2

Knowing where people are and predicting movement can help people addressing pedestrian congestion across a variety of environments: city centre, restaurants, parades, protests.

The danger is of course using this form of crowd analysis to shape and mould the city environments. Shops, streets, building, would be shaped in a completely functional manner which only takes into account 2D space and not 3D + lighting.

In many ways, the need for improvement seems greater outside cities, but the lower density also suggests that data would be more thinly distributed.

City population churn patterns might be an interesting area for study (assuming cities are full of incomers), to investigate how behaviours change over time, and whether there's a typical pattern of activity for newcomers to cities. Where do they come from? How do their activities and movements change over their time there? How do their social circles change? Do they stay permanently, or for some years before moving elsewhere?

In asking this, I'm aware that I have in mind a curiosity about individual stories, and whether those aggregate into identifiable patterns. But I don't know how big data might reveal those patterns.

It's good that the Civil Servants are thinking about this, but I wonder if this will ever reach the ears of the relevant ministers? As you say, these are thorny problems with no easy solutions. Once solutions are proposed, I'd like to see these aired in a wider public domain. 

It's clear from this course that many techniques for nowcasting / forecasting could be used to benefit public health and the NHS. However, this area involves processing very sensitive data that the majority would want kept away from everyone else except medical personnel. Perhaps one solution of many would be to give the Information Commissioner more teeth? I hope that this are gets discussed and solutions found.

I share some of the concerns of others about the idea of conducting experiments on people without their consent. The researchers were manipulating people's news feeds to see what effect it had on their behaviour on the social network, i.e. people who saw mostly positive posts posted mostly positive things themselves. This seems like a minor thing, but what worries me is that we are postulating that these posts on social media are a good measure of how happy someone is feeling. Taken to its logical conclusion, we could theorise that the researchers were actually making people more or less happy by conducting their experiments. Ethics is a complicated issue, but I often find it useful to consider the most extreme possible consequences of your actions are and ask yourself: ""Am I okay with this?"" In this case the researchers could make an unhappy person even more miserable, drive them into a cycle of depression which could have long-lasting consequences; it sounds melodramatic, but are we okay with that?",2015-06-17 09:50:11 UTC,,3

This brings me to another point. I think that to a large extent people using social media are presenting a persona, how they want people to perceive them, rather than how they really are. I therefore wonder how good a measure of happiness our posts on social media really are. A couple of very simple examples could be:

a) Someone who is really not very happy, but posting lots of positive things because they are trying to hide their unhappiness.
b) Related to the idea that happiness spreads through social networks, someone who sees positive posts by a friend, e.g. ""I just had a really great weekend."" and feels a need for 'one-upmanship' posts something like: ""I just had the best weekend ever!!!""",2015-06-17 09:50:35 UTC,,3

I think the difference between astrology and big data is that big data is statistically correlated whereas astrology as purposefully vague so that the audience seeks to find subjective correlations in everything. 

As someone who has spent many hours trading the stock market prior to this course, I think this reminds me of a critique of the idea of Technical Analysis (identifying stock market opportunities via trends/patterns in stock market data) in that people expect Technical Analysis to predict the future, which is impossible because of human nature. With that said, because you cannot predict the future with 100% accuracy doesn't mean that the methods are irrelevant.

Yesterday, driving home from work, I heard the term precariat used for the first time, in a BBC Radio 4 feature. From Wikipedia.

In sociology and economics, the precariat is a social class formed by people suffering from precarity, which is a condition of existence without predictability or security, affecting material or psychological welfare...

Increasingly this socio-economic group is encompassing an educated lower-middle class whose old certainties are being swept away by the pace of change in the white collar labour market.

Such models could be useful as well in making sure that police resources are allocated to areas more likely to experience crime in the immediate future (especially considering the likelihood of criminals to return to an area again in the days following the initial attack).

That seems unfortunate, as it basically positions big data as technology, rather than sociology. As such it's interesting that it goes on to treat the whole subject as an 'out there' and arms-length thing, with good potential for business. But this is a tone quite familiar from listening to (UK) government rhetoric on the internet, as something 'other' that's up to 'internet businesses' to be responsible for running. Equally, here, it seems to treat big data as a business opportunity, rather than a way of government better understanding the population the state is representing and serving. So, as a parliamentary briefing, it seems to fall short on 'in-house' uses of big data, such as how it could impact and inform public policy, and the only reference we have is to local government level.

It's interesting that there's a 'discrimination' section, but this seems to lay marketing/policy problems at the door of data; while overlooking the risk that decisions based on big data might disenfranchise those not contributing to that data pool.",2015-06-18 22:59:22 UTC,,4

It is important to dig right information and utilize substantial tool for practical applications. 

Furthermore, big data will gain importance in governance of future cities, crowd management, health, transportation and crime management. Similarly, various industries such as entertainment, food, health and other can monitor big data and predict and meet basic needs of people. This will aid to support the logistic and supply chain companies to increase capacity and plan for the unpredicted situations.

However that technology isn't advanced enough yet to be unintrusive, closed loop (automatically increases or decreases insulin delivery), or measure glucose levels with consistent and precise accuracy. Neither can it monitor food eaten, stress levels, illness, activity levels-all factors which contribute to altered glucose levels.

How many blue light services should be on call for a 50,000 crowd, or 100,000?  Where are they best located?  Big data can also be used for forecasting but as Sue Moat says - use it like the weather forecast -with your own degree of faith built in.  Transport planning is a serious application, but I would like to see more done for pedestrians - previous town planning has been car-led.  We are starting a bicycle led approach but leaving the poor old pedestrian often having to come 3rd in priority and left to go the long way round in sometimes dubious environments.  This is counter-productive - give pedestrians easier ans shorter/safer routes and we will walk more.  Anybody working on this?

The main question in my mind is back to the global geography - it's interesting to see that more and more 3rd world countries are picking up on the smart device - they may even miss a generation of technology and come in early.  But how can we be using big data to develop these economies and even get down to the first couple of blocks in Maslow's Hierarchy?

I thought that a similar study could be done for the case of Venezuela, comparing:  searches for  the word  dengue,  rain precipitation per day (dengue is transmitted by mosquito, more rain = more mosquitos) and recent records of dengue cases (which I doubt exist).  But then I remembered that in fact we would most probably have a gross under nowprediction, as the Venezuela population that has access to internet -  the urban middle & upper-class- is a significant minority.   So once again any now-prediction of epidimology should take into account who are the users/searchers, are they really representative of the universe, (in this case  potential patiences of flue) or only representative of  another universe (e.g urban middle-upper class potential patiences).  So my question is: When using big data, do we have an equivalent of sample weighting, when we know that a section of a population (for example for rural areas, age group, social class) is  underestimated in our big data (simply because they do not have/use internet)?",2015-06-19 14:53:25 UTC,,1

There is an msc in predictive analytics http://www.cdm.depaul.edu/academics/pages/ms-in-predictive-analytics.aspx
It looks focused mainly on healthcare applications

There is a quite nice list if other degrees at (they are mostly business intelligence degrees) http://www.mastersindatascience.org/schools/data-science-degrees-online/

The question was asked “Is big data good or bad”. Frankly it does not really matter. Big data is with us and will not go away whether it’s good or bad and like everything else will be used with good and bad intentions.

Yes, because there is, to a certain extent, a standard way of delivering this education, probably largely governed by the delivery medium and also the format that FutureLearn (and others) mandate to be effective on the widest number of technological platforms.

The nature of education means that in order to learn about something new, that information needs to be standardised in order that beginners get the basic grounding. One can only achieve mastery of a subject by being intimately familiar with the subject and then knowing when to break the rules to come up with new knowledge.

No, because I'm lucky enough to be able to access MOOC's for free. The only cost I pay is in my time. At the present time, I don't have the health resources available to me to attend university, let alone the monetary resources and via the MOOC I've been able to get knowledge imparted by the University of Warwick using only a reasonably powered machine.

Big data can reveal when people make particular journeys, and might highlight unusual patterns - perhaps some commuting routes peak earlier or later. Which routes are used disproportionately by cyclists? What might be the reasons (e.g. just one hellishly difficult junction) and how can unpopular cycle routes be made more attractive?
Uber is also an application of big data, constantly seeking to match supply to demand (and occasionally the other way round by hiking up prices) - more advanced versions of this approach will facilitate the use of autonomous vehicles, which can be deployed exactly where they're needed based on Big Demand Data.",2015-06-21 17:45:53 UTC,,9

Whilst the decisions themselves may not be major it can have a cumulative effect adding lots of small 'correct' decisions together giving people a better quality of life.  Where once people would have limited or no data to make these decision basing choices on past experience alone they are more exposed to making the 'wrong' choice which may have further consequences down the line.

It's not only that these decision making data sets now exist but people can get access to them in real time via their phones.  So if plans need to be changed at short notice again people are less likely to be forced to re-plan based on old data (for example basing their choices on real time traffic rather then a traffic report on the news when they left home).",2015-06-25 13:32:12 UTC,,4

I would imagined the 'older'  and more culturally engrained is a human behaviour in a society the easiest it is to predict.  However, it does not mean it want change, and that change will not be drastic.  If we are going to look at human behaviour, I would say it is a big mistake to simply aggregate, with out considering the community that specific individual belongs to.  Some societies are more closed, so trends will be more static, others are more open and hence trends will be variable. Some are open in just in some aspects and very close in others.  So hence most probably big data helps more with nowcasting than forecasting.   ",2015-06-26 13:08:23 UTC,,0

I think it is very necessary to have good knowledge of R, Python and a compiled language like C or C++.  Julia is an interesting project, you can use Spark which allows you to work with R, Python and Julia on very large datasets and even small ones. There are also several R packages that helps with working on largesets as well as on slow computations.",2015-06-30 14:05:52 UTC,,0

This is part of the culture, and it could also be manipulated by the media, tv, movies, etc. 

There are 2 types of factors to study: the ones that make you happier, and the ones that make you change the beliefs of what to be happy is.
