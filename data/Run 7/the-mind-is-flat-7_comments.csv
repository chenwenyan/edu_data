I would debate that the mind does have depth, unlike the rainbow analogy. The 'writing' presentation is a perfect example of how to trick the mind, yes? So, to me, this means the mind can be persuaded to abandon the traditional 'flat-line' assumptive thinking, and follow a course which in most cases is led by the ego! Advertisers and marketers use this technique on a daily basis. Why did you buy your last whatever? For me, it's a matter of 'knowing' your mind, which leads to the deeper consideration of 'what is mind'? Mark Parsons states that the mind and brain are two parts of us. Sorry Mark, I can't locate my mind! If Nick is correct in his proposal, and we are just reacting on the fly, to each situation, improvising, even with solid reference points in our history, we are still lying to ourselves.

I've been contemplating about this... For example, I questioned why I don't pursue something I want to do because my inner voice tells me that I am not good at it. This goes against logics, because to be good at something, at the very least one has to do it first. 

I investigated certain mind habits and patterns of behaviour and even a childhood memory associated with feeling of rejection and failure blablabla...which quite frankly, I cannot even rely on how true my memory is.

So, how can I know any truth using my own thinking that may be jumbled with emotions and feelings even if they aren’t so apparent in my conscious mind?

I don't think we can separate the mind from the physical entity - continuous on-going, ""on line"" re-assembling by neuron connections in the brain. 

The idea of denying the existence of an objective reality (the one being obstinately there even when we are not looking)  does not bring us a better working theory, so I use Occam's razor and go for the simplest option...

This ""working model"" of reality shows, that the universe was going about its business for billions of years without us tiny conscious glimpses appearing on this random (if beautiful) planet, and sadly, it will go on again when the sun gets too old and eats up the earth - unless we get ourselves - really seriously intelligent...

At it's base we have the survival brain - which starts with being able to cry at such a tone and frequency that ensures our parents re-act to our needs. 
Later we develop a conditioned brain that asks us to accept that parents, teachers, experts, elders, royalty are superior to us. 
Do I not have a logical brain so that if I buy 1 apple and then immediately buy another 1, I will always have 2, no matter how many times I repeat that scenario? 
What about a social brain which has us respond to the 1st viewing of our friends ugly new born with something like 'Such beautiful eyes', which may well be part of the Improviser brain as described.
Some people who commit suicide have battled with problems for years before finding the suicide 'solution', but then spend months ensuring that those they care for are 'provided for' in all terms other than emotional, before implementing the 'solution', which suggests that the logical brain can overcome the survival one.

Also being unable to think, decide, work things out verbally, I realise how much I just know everything emotionally, experimentally, intuitively and largely almost unconsciously - Though obviously only things I am in various ways aware of - no way could I ever learn to do or know anything I was just told, or which did not interest me.

If we take shares as an example, much of the price of a share on any given day is made up of not just the desirability of that share but also of the general market sentiment. That is evident at any election as shares bounce up or down depending upon who looks like being elected and if that is perceived as good or bad for business.

""The obvious reason the robots of 'Westworld' draw more sympathy than the humans is their vulnerability, the fact that their daily lives require a passive acceptance of the abuse, terror, and tragedy that's heaped upon them. But Maeve's (a host robot) peek behind the curtain hints at a more fundamental cause: As the engineers, coders, and technicians dismantle and reconstruct the hosts, the show constantly forces us to reflect on how we humans are composed, too. How many of our own actions are scripted? How much can we really improvise? And what purpose did our own creator have in mind for us?

Particularly when stressed if the mind cannot find a match to make sense of the data it will go tend to go for a best fit solution( aka a guess) rather than take time to gather more information , recheck the input data or carry out a sense check with known realities.

However it is possible to discipline the mind to take a more measured approach to problem solving and decision making,  especially if the subject has been trained to do so. I'm not sure how this view fits with 'making up the answers as we go along' or 'an illusion of understanding'. 

I can't make up my mind whether the presenter is being deliberately challenging or is onto something really game changing about the way we don't think.

As for airport queuing I suspect that the advertised holiday brochure view of enjoying a relaxing time is somewhat at odds with the hard sell to a captive audience and interminable delays by a lack of staff at security due to cost cutting.
 I recently had one of those phone calls where a chap stated 'Hi this is John from.....' which surprised me as I don't know any 'John' speaking with an Indian continental accent. This was made worse when he finally stopped to draw breath and in the background I heard lots of other 'Indian' voices saying 'Hi this is John from.....'.

That's where GOD stands till now. Can't be proven. Our breath is God. And science can't stop it from STOPPING. we go to mars. But we can't stop death. Till then the belief and doubt will go on.

Why is it a given that the Brexit vote was such a horrendous and somehow 'wrong' choice? Why the obsession with remaining part of the so-called EU club? Or do you like being part of a supranational monster that is almost entirely undemocratic, terribly bureaucratic and corrupt beyond measure? The EU is a farce and the very antithesis of sovereignty and democracy. It gives a false sense of viability by providing free movement in lieu of governance with less accountability and more obfuscation, not to mention corruption on a grand scale. The EU should have remained, at most, the European Economic Community - no more, no less. Since the 1990s it has morphed into the corrupt, undemocratic monster that it is. It should be put to death and all its members go back to being fully sovereign nations with open markets, as needed and as regulated by their own parliaments for the interest of their own people.

In this respect our minds are flat.

What a difference hindsight makes, when we think back on why we responded, either in thought or action, in a particular way we can create all sorts of explanations (stories) to justify, excuse, etc., our thoughts and actions. Similarly, when we have time to consider how we should behave in a particular situation we think of scenarios (stories) to reach our desired outcome.

Even with the political section of the experiment, the conservatives and social democrats if chosen as to represent right and left - hardly have much difference in their policies really for the last 50 years or so. If the persons in the experiment are not particularly ""political animals"" , again, the choice is not important for them.

Considering that shopping choices and even often, political choices do not count as something to take seriously these days for a significant proportion of people, I can see that the various marketing technologies can become factors to sway such people.

So it is difficult.  Out in the real world, unless you are internally distracted, you are more likely to notice an interruption because:  it is not familiar;  you need to know it (danger),  you are observant of or open to your surroundings, you are focused on something specific.   This is irrespective of your illusional construct.    Although I agree that the illusional construct can lead you to make mistakes.

I have real difficulty with ""I have to think a while to think what my emotions are....."".  ???
Emotions are not entirely seated in the mind.  The brain drives the nervous system throughout the body:  queasy stomach - fear;  hiccoughs and butterflies - excitement;  tightness in the belly - anger.   These feelings don't have to be thought about to be felt and recognised.

Which yes is true, however I do have these price values of different items of clothing which I do not fully understand where they have came from. For example, I am happy to pay £45 for a pair of jeans from a store but then would not pay £40 for a top from the same place. This is because I have this embedded value of different products and how I see their 'value', however I do not know where this has came from. This is not because of a higher interest of these types of products either, so why is it that I am willing to pay more for one item of clothing over another. Is it simply because I have constantly seen these items at a higher price and therefor believe that they are of a higher value?

I tend to believe this but can understand the arguments against as it is disconcerting to think about how little control we have in life.

I am interested in the thought of hindsight bias and some of the responses that have been made about it. I was struck by the quote ""...we don't have, as we flow through our lives, a clear record what we believe, of what we value, of the nature of our experiences."" One might expect interpretation to occur. I thought of witness statements to an event. The witnesses were all present but their statements vary in their accuracy but they all saw the same thing. If they tell different things then how can one be certain of life's other events, experiences, thoughts and emotions? 

I was also interested in the additional reading concerning egocentrism as a common problem for ""...adults and children alike as labouring under a 'curse of knowledge,' in which having knowledge biases one to think that others have the same knowledge"" (page 10). Even attempting common ground the bias can intrude. Aaargh!",2016-11-08 11:38:12 UTC,1,,,,

In terms of change blindness specifically, it is a concept I was already aware of and have watched multiple videos and experiments similar to this but I never fail to feel amazed after I complete another one. An interesting video is one with two basketball teams - those in white and those in black - and you're asked to count the number of passes the white team makes. After the video, you realise that you were so focussed on the white team and the ball that you failed to notice a gorilla walk into the frame, dance around, and walk out. Humorous take on the concept.

In this course, I've loved the number of videos - especially with a ""heavy"" course like this - I know I personally learn a lot better with videos than articles.

If you are the person contemplating suicide, there may be many arguments, based on your own knowledge and life experience, for and against that action,  including religious beliefs and instinctive reasons for self-preservation. Unless your reason is impaired by, say, overwhelming despair, your final decision will be arrived at after considering a complex range of arguments and after experiencing and being influenced by a complex range of emotions, even if you were to find it impossible to put into words every aspect of thought or emotion leading up to your decision. Whether we call these arguments and emotions surface or part of the mind’s depth is purely semantics.

The fact that I cannot tell the motivations, in terms of thoughts and emotions, of another human being before he or she committed suicide does not prevent me speculating about them, whether or not there is concrete evidence to assist my speculations, such as a suicide letter. A great deal of human society involves speculating on the motivations of other human beings to explain past  or to assist in predicting future conduct. In making those speculations we will use our knowledge of the person and his or her circumstances and of the society in which that person lived.

For some reason we seem prepared to invest the same amount of energy in speculating on the motivations of fictional characters, and we base those speculations on the same sort of knowledge gleaned from, say, the novel that we would use for a real person. We may also choose, if we so wish, to use any knowledge we have about the author to assist us in our speculations, in this case our knowledge of the life and thought of Count Leo Tolstoy and the society in which he lived.

See http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/mood-disorders
In the UK it's Low Mood Disorders - in the US Dysthemic Disorders & it constitutes a psychiatric diagnosis. 

The assessment of Low Mood doesn't take into account emotion alone. It considers a No. of mental capacities, inc. speech content & ability, outlook, thoughts, emotions, other mental experience, eg: rumination, fixation, psychotic experience, etc. 

On top of this is assessment of general external appearance indicating ability to look after oneself; also ability to expression emotions - for eg: smile, cry, moan, laugh; Also effect on the use of limbs; eg: shuffling or slow movement, bad posture, twitching ; length of time & pattern of reported distress or breakdown in routine and so on. 

All these together contribute towards indicting appropriate diagnosis, of which there are many that might apply within the depression - low mood canon.

I don't think that episodes of mental unwellness suddenly separate from 'mind', stop being mind, deferring only to emotion. Also it's difficult for me to impose a notion of flatness to the experience of a turbulent mind. Quite the opposite is suggested & often reported.",2016-11-08 17:15:52 UTC,1,,,,

It would only be an assumption as it is in reality.

It then becomes a guessing game to all concerned as to 'WHY?'  but you will never truly get below the surface of the facts known.

The research in neuroscience is indicating that we are run by our sub.conscousness far more than we realise.

The magician shows two pictures that have a black backing which matches the table. The person points to one of the pictures.

From the subject's perspective, the picture they chose couldn't have been switched with the other picture because the magician's hands never crossed or met, and they don't catch the sleight of hand.

The subject remembers seeing two pictures. They remember picking one. They saw the magician hand the picture to them and have no reason to doubt what they ""saw"". And then they quite often but not always forget that they actually picked the other person's image.

The point though is that when it does happen, the people create elaborate explanations about why they prefer one over the other.

I think this is because, like was mentioned in the previous videos, happiness isn't an absolute, measurable feeling. It is relative. Relative to those around you, those you compare with. If one was to compare oneself to a miserable person, one might think that they were very happy (9/10). If the comparison was made to someone that was seemingly extremely content and happy, one will say that they aren't as happy (say, 6/10). Since everyone around us is getting richer and progressing at roughly the same pace that we are - by virtue of being citizens of the same country - each person won't be able to say that they're getting happier because although the country is growing economically, everyone else is also becoming ""happier"" to the same extent - cancelling it all out in a way.

I'm sceptical about the existence of hidden mental depth. We clearly have the capacity to store mental ... stuff. We have memories, albeit unreliable ones.

Returning briefly to the opening presentation I was taken with the phrase about being fictional characters in our own story, since I am aware of different narratives that I have told to myself about myself at different stages of my life and how these may have shaped my choices, my behaviour. 

In this presentation I am left reflecting on the difference between making a choice and then being asked to describe or explain that choice. Could it be that, when being presented with a situation in which there is no time to reflect, simply choose, choices are made based on the story we have constructed for ourselves of ourselves, shaped by our perception of influences and experiences we have previously encountered.  However, if we are then asked to describe why we have made that choice, instead of simply saying, ""I don't know"", acknowledging that we are not consciously aware of why we chose that way, we accept the pressure to come up with a response and construct a story that makes sense to us in the moment.  

Along with many other questions, I find myself asking why it is that we might be unable or unwilling to say ""I don't know""

Clearly the answer to this is yes – in some circumstances - a purchase might not be worth as much to me as I originally thought because of the views of someone I later ask for an opinion, or because of a moral or political issue. 
Do I worry about this? I think about the worth of a purchase and try to make those purchases in places where I can return items easily – buying from a high-street store rather than a street market. I would also not knowingly purchase from a store or manufacturer where the manufacturer uses child labour or other employment practices outlawed in the UK – but given the complex, global production processes in manufacturing today I know I often fail in this objective! I don't worry enough to make my own clothes though!",2016-11-09 17:30:51 UTC,0,,,,

The air conditioner experiment illustrates this. Our brain thinks we know how an air conditioner works because in our experience we turn it on and it blows cold air until the air in the room is reduced to a preset temperature. That is generally all we need to know about how an air conditioner works in order to use one. So when we are asked 
our brain tells us we know how an air conditioner works but this is only superficial, we do not understand the detail.


We all suffer from hindsight bias (and many other biases) to some degree.

Beware of seeing yourself through other people's eyes, you tend to be subjective; getting personally / emotionally involved. Then you may improvise with justification.
M. Angelou infers that Actions speak louder than words, objectively you may see the true character of the person, before they can improvise, or justify with a response. If we minimize change blindness we may possibly observe the true person.

Due to the idea that we rely on the flat mind which  provides us with the information from past events, people observed and actions copied etc, it would make sense that we would need to improvise our minds in order to deal with situations, environment, surroundings and people etc with no precedence involved. So we have to make new decisions based on improvisation to suit the new situation we are facing.  For example if whilst out walking my dog, I fell badly into a ditch, unable to move (a new experience for me).  I would look to the Flat mind for any precedence to formulate a decision as to how I would get out of this situation.  However there is no precedence of a similar situation. It is at this point the mind has to become 'The Improviser' to be able to reach a certain and definite conclusion as to what my recovery action choices are.

It must be remembered that psychology is not a pure science and reporting is based on statistical analyses of data- we don't all conform to the 'standard'. I was a little less sceptical when I started this course and so far this course has not succeeded in convincing me otherwise.

The financial decisions example is interesting because the early part of the discussion seems a perfectly legitimate process for a layman who does not know - the daily newspapers all have 'Money'pages. 

However, to apply the argument to the financial markets does not appear to be necessarily appropriate. The issue was (and probably still is) the hubris  of individuals trading in particular derivatives in the belief they understood the risks when those risks had only been evaluated properly by those who had created the derivative. The markets began to unravel when one individual asked the question. A good example of illusion of understanding.

2.  ""However, as for fictional characters, so with real people: the sense that behaviour is merely the surface of a vast sea, immeasurably deep and teeming with inner motives, beliefs and desires whose power we can barely sense is a conjuring trick played by our own minds. The truth is not that the depths are empty, or even shallow; but that the surface is all there is.""

The rainbow analogy is not a model of how the mind works, but is analogy of the output of the mind working, in that it changes based on where you look from, the moment in time and that one person's view or perception of a rainbow will be different from another.  But a rainbow is a physical manifestation of the combination of light and water interacting (as described in this exercise), and I am not sure I see this as a useful representation of the mind working - other than how the output can be variously perceived.

The generation of different types of rainbow in different situations and times is a better analogy of how I currently feel the mind works, rather than the rainbow itself.",2016-11-10 00:48:57 UTC,8,,,,

However, when asked about the 24 hour wait period between days 365 and 366, the 24 hours are negligible because our minds are comparing it to the directly available and at hand 365 days (8760 hours to be precise).

Your point reminds me of something I have long thought about: Why don't men like to ask directions when they get lost? (Is this a proven fact?)

Women on the other hand often will ask the way and additionally (in my experience) will accept the advice of a complete stranger over that of their own husbands! ;-)

My theory is that men know that people really do not like to say 'I don't know' they prefer to hazard a guess and if you are looking for directions this human trait can send you on some very long detours. Anyone had the same experience as me?

A friend went to psychotherapy for many sessions to deal with her lifelong, problematic relationship with her mother.

What I find fascinating about the act of reading and the attempt to understand character is that it involves so many different actions and skills. We have to begin with the text because that's where the writer does his or her work. but then (as you say) our own experience comes into play as the characters become ""real"" to us and enter that place between the text (where they exist only as marks printed on paper) and incorporation into our minds (where the text is decoded and analysed). I think that, as we become more and more familiar with the characters as we read, we begin responding to them as real, physical, beings and a dialogue begins. For me, having read the book recently, Anna is as real in memory as any other person I've encountered. Next time I read the book I'll see her differently, but I think that will only add to her reality in my mind.

They help by, like mentioned, introducing competition which results in lower prices for the consumer (still perhaps exorbitant, but just slightly less so) and prevents consumers being duped by any one company in terms of pricing. They also help by providing variety which is usually necessary.

Hindering does, of course, occur too. Using clever marketing strategies like ""bundling"", as consumers we end up thinking we need more than we really do. Also, influencing our decision to buy a certain product by tweaking how we are asked what it is that we want to focus on (price, location, etc) and by introducing seemingly irrelevant and inconsequential options - ones we know we'd probably never pick anyway but somehow their presence does effect the final outcome. Also by tweaking the options available, consumers can be influenced to go for an option they wouldn't normally pick - just to stay in the ""middle-zone"" of the bell curve.

The main difference I think between those and this material is studying the justification people have for their behaviour, rather than just the behaviour itself. 

I don't think having a hidden mental depth and the mind being an improviser are mutually exclusive - the hidden mental depth can refer to the huge quantity of information stored on various things, whereas the mind can improvise based on this information and act as a facade if needed. I think the 'flat mind' refers to this facade and the capabilities of the brain to make up for any gaps in mental depth, and how there may be defaults set for human behaviour.

With the Bali/Bournemouth example, before getting to the question ""which holiday would you reject?"" my thoughts on the holiday I would like to go to would be Bali due the the diversity I would find there and the possibility of better weather.  I also thought, however, that there were downsides, i.e. the cost (though that was not a strong factor for me) and the language obstacles I would face on holiday there.

Now I could say that it's relative happiness potential makes the cost less than his judgement. But that doesn't matter much to him. So, we do then use an internal meter and calculate our incomes v our expenditure v comfort v accessibility v convenience of available dates v how much we liked it last year v whether it was jollier than where we went the year before that v value for money v our collective knowledge of Spanish v good local restaurants and shops etc. Is that ad hoc?

I am not entirely convinced that when depth of knowledge and analytical training is second nature to a person it is not used.  

Am I the only one who still thinks that, while there are times we believe we are making choices based upon analysis when in fact we are not aware of all the factors involved, it does not mean then when we have close to perfect knowledge we do not use it.

After more questions a viewer may be under the impression that we had seen different pictures.  

In fact the pictures were all the same but the text was different.  One half was told the picture was a flier for a circus the other half were told the picture was a flier for ballroom dancing.  The picture itself was like the popular old woman/young lady and depending on how one looked at it one could see a seal with a ball and a trainer or ballrooms dancers.

“Perhaps the introduction of the new minimum wage will put extra money in peoples pockets, but with interest rates on savings accounts at rock bottom and the government causing confusion by constantly meddling with pension rules, I fear the numbers using this additional income to save will be minimal.”

And 50% of adults don't have problem at all - they cannot afford savings.
Most people have their state pensions and if they're lucky, a company pension - which is not guaranteed it seems (see BHS, Daily Mirror, etc etc) can be stolen by the owners.

And for everybody else, including the finance-specialist, it is a lottery - no wonder one cannot be bothered worrying when presented with these silly questionnaires about risk-taking.  Especially when interest rates are for your every-day savings are very low.

So your lucky pensioner from the minority who can afford worry about what to do with savings - they tend to do what their bank-manager tells them... even if they first have to fill the form about what risk they were willing to take...

The construction of comparisons below was extraordinarily unhelpful because it doesn't reflect any reality and therefore any knowledge one may draw from it, is useless.

And once again:  ""Is there really any more to being happy than thinking you're happy.""
How about 'feeling happy', or are feelings not part of the mind?  The human predeliction for putting everything in boxes maybe neat and be seen as clarifying but out here in the real world (where nature lives) the results are distorted and often nonsense.  I go back to the idea that if you don't understand something you study it and choose variables for this.  If you don't understand something, you choice of variables will be biased and likely incomplete.

I also think the fact that the subject matter is a human face, influences this behaviour. 
We are more likely to behave as we would towards another human, for example with care, less critical, perhaps also aware that rating people on appearance alone seems quite a shallow thing to do. Whereas if it was a scenic photo or inanimate object I would imagine a greater number of people would be more vocal in rejecting the wrong one.

I give only one alternative here, there are likely many.
I think he takes the example only as he wishes to see it, as proof of the theory he is trying to put across, therefore is himself acting with confirmation bias, rather than allowing nuance, other possible motives or an emotional response to influence his judgement.

My choice was influenced by others in a general way: the museum shop was attractive and pleasant to browse in, and the displays were aesthetically pleasing, as they often are in an art based environment, so I was encouraged to linger and look after leaving the exhibition.

It is difficult to measure happiness but there are many proxy measures for unhappiness:  suicide rates, drug and alcohol misuse, absence from work due to stress, antidepressant use although there is the potential to address these issues in ways that do not increase happiness, e.g. by restricting antidepressant prescribing 

I think there is  more opportunity for comparison now with facebook, instagram etc, everybody   sharing where they have been and what they have bought for the sole purpose really of competition. Also the world is so much more accessible now, whereas years ago you would have socialised predominantly with people very similar to you and while it's rewarding to have all the different experiences this affords, it can highlight all the things we're missing.

and if you are young - there is small statistical evidence that you have money to invest to start with. Unless, of course, your family funds your endeavour. Remember, whatever you've heard about Bill Gates in the garage, he also came from a well-heeled and well-connected family and he was very lucky. Probably clever/intelligent/etc, too, but that is never enough. 
and what we learned - money is not necessarily the measure of happiness, only the measure of power, and power is not something that provides happiness, especially if so unequally distributed. Having enough money helps you to be unhappy or happy in a comfortable environment...  
Being better off than others makes some feel more secure, not happy.
I feel unhappy about other people's misery, and that is probably due to feeling insecure, not being so goody-goody.

I work in the area of culture and creativity and we are very clear that the values that inform what we do are entirely determined by the communities in which we operate. We use the model of a 'Triple bottom line' based on a constantly variable synthetic alignment of cultural value, social value and financial value to understand what success looks like and how we make interventions. While each of these value sets may have different perceptions of objective value within communities, it can be argued (and I would endorse this) that none of them actually have any kind of objective value - making the flat perceptual form of 'objectivity' being explored in this course so incredibly important.

1. Focusing on consumer behaviour theories will expose a less stable, more short term way mental cognition creates interaction with reality or underlies behaviour. But it's important to assert that we don't all exist in that consumer mode all the time. The consumer context is a highly controlled and artificial phenomena. One could argue the accompanying cognition is stressful and unnatural to the human. 
Mind flatness within this context could be related to a loss of self-control and the problematic of overt external manipulation. 
All the decision making assumptions sighted in this video are consumer and not existential in orientation.

2. This shouldn't be a flat mind vs all over models of mind. The mind does hold an archaeological dimension which we experience as the sensation of memory and the process of making identity i.e those elements of self, and reality which need to be retained, remain stable and exist to keep continuity of recognition over long time scale.

Pointing to the illusion of things, for example the illusion of value, isn't so much clever as simply a truism. Doing so exposes the nature of power in reality. 
It's far from correct to therefore directly conclude that we live ""in a world in which no one knows the value of anything"". Quite the contrary, precisely because of the instability at the heart of power & reality, we place rigid controls on the concept of value and it is one of the most difficult and restrictive concepts which governs all our lives.

This tension between the socially binding and the unbound nature of reality is never resolved and exists in permanent conflict, tugging in both direction at all times.

Does the experience of reality's illusion confirm the flatness of mind - that is, a mind, unconscious of itself and always only present in the present ? This has not as yet been made demonstrative. Possibly i could argue the inverse.

This is the territory of classic Deconstructionist philosophy and Post Modern Theory. 

The mind-model proposed in the Mooc 'How to read a mind' situated itself within a context of 'Literature'. I'm not yet sure in what context 'flat mind' is seeking to locate itself.

But I spend a lot on food and don't buy any prepared meals etc. I think this has a lot to do with the successful marketing that's been done by a sector of the food industry and perhaps some government initiatives as well. And yet I read recently that most degenerative diseases are programmed by our genetics, so unless you doing something very dangerous (like smoking say) you're unlikely to statistically improve your health situation through eating all these antioxidants, smoothies and power food vegetables. But having a regular (daily) exercise routine can apparently boost good health significantly over couch-potato types, even increasing life expectancy. And exercise can be free. 
I think this is very clever development of a high profit sector (by part of the food industry) on the back of the emerging health/obesity crisis. I find myself increasingly reading articles etc. on emerging power foods and then there's a nearly overwhelming temptation to incorporate that new food into my diet, despite lack of hard evidence...just in case.

I didn't buy the cheapest as this was of a poorer quality to my preferences, but also I didn't want to pay the asking price for a new copy as I felt if I wasn't gripped by the book then I would have wasted money.

I am, I think mistakenly, interpreting it to mean that the mind is superficial, or makes decisions superficially; that it is simple and we are wrong to look for complexity and depth when it doesn't exist.  Indeed, the video includes a sentence along the lines of 'people are far more complicated than that'.  So is the 'Mind is Flat' the right strap-line for the concept being presented?
3. I find some of the examples or approach in this video simplistic. Some people do have (a) the memory/knowledge and/or (b) intellect to explain how most things work. So where do they fit in? And I think most people can say why they eat what they do for breakfast. I am not sure I agree with the illusion of understanding - I think we do or don't (understand) but that is different from what gets communicated.
4. Without having nailed the meaning of the 'Mind is Flat', I am finding it hard to relate to the exercises currently.",2016-11-11 19:08:01 UTC,3,,,,

It has nothing to do with being gullible or being duped.   It is to do with the way our brain/mind/thoughts/whatever you want to call it, operates when we are presented with a situation or selection of data in a particular way. This is far more subtle than the coarseness of  'con tricks' or the way supermarkets display and price products (although these also play on our psychology). Yes it may be 'old ideas' but that doesn't mean it has any less value, we may think we're smart but we're all susceptible, to a greater or lesser degree, to these ideas without even knowing it (in many cases even with hindsight).

He describes reality as virtual and as we shift our attention to one site, on place or whatever, all what we precieve is 'data'. He argues that what's in there- where you look- doesn't exist the way we think it does, rather it's  simply seen and precieved as we look at it.

I haven't come across any proven link between pesticide residues on foods and cancer. There are stringent regulations about such things, in the US and Australia as well as Europe. (https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-tolerances)

I don't think we should be complacent. It may be that the minute quantities of different pesticides remaining as residues in food even after washing could have a cumulative and combinative effect, and increase disease risk in the long term. And in any case, using less pesticides is undoubtedly better — for farmworkers, for farmers, for animals, for the environment, as well as for consumers. But the idea that you could get a stomach ache from ingesting the tiny amounts of pesticide that might remain in food eaten at a single meal is simply not plausible.

It's worth bearing in mind that some GM crops are engineered to be resistant to insect attacks, reducing the need for spraying with insecticides. There's also the issue of which pesticides are used. Glyphosate use has undoubtedly gone up over the years. But glyphosate is a safer pesticide than atrazine and paraquat and others that have been or are being phased out (http://www.crediblehulk.org/index.php/2015/06/02/glyphosate-toxicity-looking-past-the-hyperbole-and-sorting-through-the-facts-by-credible-hulk/). A couple of years ago there was a meta-analysis of the impacts of GM crops that found that they actually reduced pesticide use by, on average, 37% (http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111629). Of course, that might no longer be true. (The problem of glyphosate-resistant weeds leading to greater use of other pesticides is real.) The point I'm trying to make is that this is a complex issue.

- I'm confused about his use of rainbows. First, he seems to be confusing the concept of a rainbow having depth and it having a fixed position in space. Secondly (and perhaps this is my scientific background coming out), doesn't everyone know that it is caused by the refraction of light by water in the atmosphere, so the position of the rainbow moves with both the sun and the observer

Maybe most convincing is research by Jonathan Haidt, that showed how much our intuition, not reasoning, is guiding our choices. So, main objection is that saying reasoning is flat may be true, and I personally agree, but saying that mind is flat is plainly wrong because even in this video there ARE values (positive or negative) that are attached according to frame (and are just switched among according to it).

- I was right about winning chances, (why is that important?) 
because as I am really good at it, I can place my bets more efficiently, (why is that important?)

And no, people would be not “psychologically” or “flatly” unhappy about that – as they have been used to that for the last few thousand years since a surplus is appropriated by those with the power to do so,  the problem is in the last few decades, that the distribution became even more skewed, with the bottom 90% not getting better, and due to the stagnating standard of living and collapse of public services, getting worse off.  ...

Value power is driven by the sheer volume of products bought for £200. Confidently showing off value in our current society is powerful. 99p stores and value grocers (Lidl & Aldi) would not be growing so quickly if we were truly snobby about our shopping habits.

I don't feel that we buy because of need. We are as malleable as the next person. We create a ""want"" desire and we will justify the purchase to ourselves (""I deserve that because I've had a shitty month..."") or to others (""I deserve that because I've had a shitty month"").

Low price, High value goods can reward the manufacturer with a higher margin than products seen in Bond St, London. The volume requisites are different, and the environment supports those needs.

The States where they campaigned the hardest and made the most appearances (Pennsylvania. Ohio, Florida, North Carolina, Michigan) all went to Trump. If the election was to be decided by popular vote the candidates strategy would have been completely different.

A lot of people must have the latest model at a not inconsiderable cost even if their previous mobile worked well and was only a year or so old.  I related to the point about queuing.  I get very frustrated when I choose the 'wrong' queue and the one next to me is moving far quicker.  Plus branded v generic painkillers.

I currently believe that what this course is trying to prove could be half correct. We improvise a lot of the time, as it’s easier to do so and it saves time and effort.

I am a bit bothered, as this sort of argument can lead to the idea that there is no point in improving the living conditions of the majority at the bottom, just make people -believe-, that they are better off than x, y and z, and they will be happy while the system goes off the democratic/economic/climatic/environmental rails. This is what demagogy (=a type of marketing?) 
is made of. (and the Matrix version of 1984) 
The idea, that the greater GDP makes everyone better off seems a bit naïve from a business school... Greater GDP reflects mostly how much more is made by the top 10%, or even more by the top 0.1%. And no, people would be not “psychologically” or “flatly” unhappy about that – as they have been used to that for the last few thousand years since a surplus is appropriated by those with the power to do so, the problem is in the last few decades, that the distribution became even more skewed, with the bottom 90% not getting better, and due to the stagnating standard of living and collapse of public services, getting worse off. ...

A: Ethical tuna is (more) important.

This is a manipulative question designed to result in an incomplete answer which undermines the process they are supposedly measuring. That is, 'self-reporting'.

It's like the Bali/ Bournemouth question except the price constraint is made entirely elastic. , trapping the victim into self-reporting their perceived morality, rather than their financial circumstances. It also makes the assumption that any form of tuna fishing is 'ethical', or one is more ethical than another. 

The price component (affordability) is CRUCIAL to the question, as it is with Bali/Bournemouth but this buffoon disallows it. A sensible question would be:

It's not always possible to exchange £1 for a particular amount of goods due to the variation in prices. In terms of acquiring money, this may be relatively easier for example in a better paid job, or if money came in the form of a bonus or a lottery win or even after an easy day/month at work; therefore an individual pound may seem to be worth less on these days? 

Transactions are made even less tangible by hire purchase agreements, mortgages or card payments. I wonder if we would be any more consistent if we were paying for goods with something less abstract such as hours worked.

(There is also the fact that due to differences in interest rates and exchange rates etc a pound is not even worth the same amount in Gold on any given day, but I don't know how many of us think in these terms).

Re-using the restaurant example, obviously I wouldn't know what to expect so at first I don't know. After, say it goes well or wrong, I would say in both cases, I genuinely didn't know.
On the other hand, if I was to give an answer, for example, it went well so I say ""Yeah, I thought it would be okay"" or it went badly and I say ""yeah, I didn't really expect it to be all that great."" But the reason behind it would have been different. The professor states that we use what we know to be true to (it was good or bad) to sort of 'manipulate' what we say we thought it would have been like (we know it was good so we say we thought it would have been good). In essence, he is stating that this is unintentional. I disagree with this. I believe that it is intentional, and it related to social desirability. If the restaurant was nice, I would say ""I thought it would be nice"" because I want the others around me to be 'impressed.' Likewise if it was bad I would say ""I knew it would be bad"" because I would want my friends (for example) to think, 'wow.'

Again, I celebrate Christmas and buy the usual Christmas products - nuts, chocolates, turkey etc.  Those choices are influenced by those of others.  As someone that celebrates Christmas I would feel not right sitting down to a meal of baked beans and toast on Christmas Day.  It does not worry me because I have the power to say no, and choose not to buy a particular product.  ",2016-11-13 21:08:26 UTC,1,,,,

I think Nick is using words like ""depth"" and ""flat"" in a particular way that's not immediately intuitive or obvious.

As I understand it, he's suggesting that we normally think of our minds as containing a lot of pre-existing ""stuff"" --- opinions, beliefs, knowledge, preferences, etc. --- and this can be envisaged as a sort of deep pool of all those different things.  In this model, when we're asked a question or have to make a decision we retrieve the relevant piece(s) of pre-existing knowledge, opinions, beliefs, etc from the pool.  So when you're asked if Orsono is a town in Chile you retrieve all the relevant information from your ""mind pool"" and use it to give your answer.  One implication of this is that the way the question is asked should have very little influence on your answer.

What Nick's suggesting is that that model is wrong.  In fact, there is no deep pool of pre-existing opinions, beliefs, knowledge, preferences, etc. and our minds basically make things up as they go along.  This makes it much more likely that the way the question is asked will influence your answer.

Essentially, then, we have the components necessary to abstract patterns from our experiences to construct reality.

Instead of our receiving 'things' as they 'really are', we are, it would seem, experiencing the external stimulation, which, once having received it, we 'understand' by processing them with the aid of 'patterns' we have constructed in the past ... and the output is our interpretation/explanation ... one of, perhaps, infinite permutations?

•Re a ‘flat’ mind - I understand this to mean that the concept of mental depth is less pronounced than we have (been led to) think. We are adept at improvising and, because the mind chooses the lazy route, are perhaps prone to improvise rather than really examine and think afresh. We are also less likely to be honest with ourselves than we like to think. Some are better than others at admitting they don't know something.

If everyone on the island has a roughly equal degree of wealth then you would expect them to report a roughly equal level of well being.

So happiness (if it is something we can define and pin down and is more than just a concept) is relative to where you sit in the hierarchy of the fulfillment of your needs.  Someone struggling to feed and house their family is more likely to report a low level of well being when they compare themselves with someone just around the corner who has sufficient food, is safely housed etc.  However that person may then compare themselves with someone just around the corner from them who has a bigger house, a seemingly ideal family life and fulfilling job and therefore report a relatively low degree of well being.

A thought which might be relevant: I recently finished a very enyoyable FL course called 'Forensic Psychology: Witness Investigation' which also told us how hopeless we were at estimating heights and distances and the Police would ask you to compare them against objects etc. Now they also told us that, on expert psychological advice, Police forces are no longer showing a selection of mug shots to eyewitnesses simultaneously in order to avoid inaccurate comparisons and instead using a sequential syle, one photograph followed by another, as a much more accurate and successful identification technique.

People who suffer seasonal affective disorder cannot talk themselves into feeling better by trying to alter their perception of brightness in the sky.

If you have just been diagnosed as being diabetic and your future is injections of Insulin, your unconscious brain will ( from millenia of experience ) signal your conscious brain to be alert for puncture wounds, knowing that such wounds are normally painful, and can lead to infection and death. Those first few jabs will hurt. 
6 or 12 months down the line, the brain will have learnt that the injections are not harmful and the pain will be minimal. 
How often do we hear of people being stabbed or shot and not feeling the wound, usually because of the more urgent need to either escape the danger or neutralise it, after which, when the danger is passed, the pain becomes very significant? Deeper in the brain, lies the ability to sort out the immediately life threatening from one which might have the same outcome in a couple of hours, and suppress pain.

The book talks about different theories and one of them is about political systems. The author explicitely states that the health of a society is determined by the health of the relationships developed within this society starting by the individual, community, town, Region, government and so on and not the extent to which a government maximazis individual choice. Thus, the duty of the government is to build the character of a society leading down to the character of the citiziens through at least foster settings that nurture virtous-healthy choices and not undermine them. So a country, that promotes values on equality, social trust, security, cooperation, meritocracy and do not foster focus on power, corruption, high competitivness and hígh economic growth.  By providind settings that nurture authentic relationships, indivduals will learn to better know themselves  and distinguish between what really makes them happy in life and what nor.

I believe that the following story is true, although I've been unable to track down a copy of the original paper by Sasser et al (1979).

The occupants of a large multi-storey office building were complaining about the speed of the elevators, saying that they were having to wait far too long once they'd pushed the button to call an elevator.  Speeding up the elevators would have been expensive, and installing additional elevators was impractical.  What could be done?

The building management installed full length mirrors outside the elevators on each floor.  The (objective) elevator speeds remained the same, but the complaints stopped.  While they were waiting for an elevator, people could check their appearance or unobtrusively observe the other people waiting for the elevator.  This vastly reduced the (subjective) unpleasantness of the waiting experience.",2016-11-14 16:32:50 UTC,5,,,,

  Did the experiments challenge your own perception of change blindness?
 YES. I had to give up on the bookshelf, and a couple of others took longer than I thought they might, but frankly who cares? And the reasons may not be the reasons claimed. Who goes through their life confronted by flashing 'spot the difference' images and questions? This in itself confuses the rational brain because it's such a stupid artificial construct. Therefore any results are bound to be distorted by this practical reality and therefore the alleged 'correct' answer is itself unproven.

Have you done something like this before? No, thank God. Though there is no God, which means I have! ;-)

This is a typical Prof. Nick loaded question. It does not have a simple YES or NO answer unless you've got what HE calls a 'flat mind'! Yes, the mind has 'mental depth', which is (in my reasoned opinion) the rational, considered, logical process. It is accurately recalled as and when needed from specific memories/known facts. Such as the colour of a bald man's hair, when that man is me! However, memory is flawed because it's been been sleeping around with other memories and producing illegitimate offspring known as 'emotions'. They're all claiming benefits they're not entitled to and rarely get out of bed before 3.00pm. No wonder they're confused and prone to telling lies, sometimes to please themselves and sometimes to please others and sometimes because they really can't remember how many kids they've created.

So, there's something in all of this discourse that is suggesting that the relativist position that our perceptions use is somehow flawed. I must admit that I'm not comfortable with this - I like the fact that my perception uses these kinds of relative scales - it sort of reinforces the notion of community - of 'we' rather than 'I'. However, the leap into the happiness debate raises all kinds of other issues that are not resolved here. If we view our consciousness (and the associated perceptions) as being part of a wider whole, then it feels more logical. That our consciousness is not our own, but a shared part of something that enters and leaves us each through common methods of perception. In this way we avoid the prospect of ever having to align perceptual scales that we believe to be absolute or objective and it reinforces that the subjective is the correct way to be.

Even with some back pedalling in this week's Talking Point, there can be no getting away from the fact that using words such as ""flat, shocking and shallowness"" have both negative and sensationalist implications.  The title and timbre of the course smack of a media or advertising campaign, not an academic university course. ",2016-11-14 23:24:41 UTC,3,,,,

The theory/research suggests that our decisions are going to be influenced by the default options, so how they are set up is of vital importance. Some advocate setting up defaults that favor personal and social well being, for example. I suspect most marketers and politicians would have other priorities.

Many course participants are saying that wealth, and the purchasing power that goes with it, is not important to them, and does not make them happy, but the reality is that for many people this is a huge driving force, and to ignore that seems naive. Perhaps we (participants) have found other sources of happiness, but for many people the acquisition of money is the main goal in life, because it is seen as (buying a) route to happiness. 

I also wonder a little about the measures of happiness for individuals. Why must you be more or less happy than you were? I am happy now, and was happy as a child, and hope and expect to be happy as I age.

Therefore questions about happiness will perhaps be answered in the context of the questions in the questionnaire. If you frame questions about happiness in terms of material success, then the answers you get may well consider comparative affluence. More open questions or questions that use a wider frame of reference may get different answers: for example, people who have been through a period of deprivation, say after a war, might focus more on essentials, such as having wind and waterproof housing, sufficient food, clothing and heat. A person who has recovered from an illness which could have been terminal might focus on the quality of his or her personal relationships with family, loved ones and friends.

It sounds wonderfully simple yet reality dictates that most of us will fluctuate up and down certain levels as real life problems arise. For example poor health can lead to job loss, which in turn can affect housing  and if you're struggling to have basic needs met it makes sense that you won't be able to reach the top of the pyramid.

However, I don't think it is quite so clear cut and personally believe that environment is key. Not so much the type of house you inhabit but the strength of the community links.

Surely, we live in a market economy, so we are expected to be aware of -market- values, which are exactly what we are -prepared- to pay for house/car/coffee.  
This market value is supposed to come together by this here very dissed  comparison-making.

We were taught that market value depends on supply and demand - so if there are not enough houses for the people who want them, they are -forced- to pay more, whether they like it or not, the -market- value goes up.

so, to blame it all on some sort of psychological irrationality, seems  like an invalid argument to me.    If you must blame -  blame the system, that is not even capable of having an absolute value marked out for things we need.

We don't measure the value of something we buy purely in terms of the numerical value of the coins or notes we hand over. We measure it against our own wealth, or yes, even what's in our wallet at the time. There's nothing weird about that. That's utterly rational.

If I were willing to pay half as much to avoid medium pain when it's compared with high pain as I would when it was compared with low pain, you cannot reasonably conclude that that must be ""purely because the brain is not a very good shock measurer"", though that may be part of it.

It’s one thing to say you’re going to bet on a horse and quite another to actually do so.

I doubt that, in practice, people who have to make difficult decisions, whether about finance or something else,  make decisions that way. You never make a life-changing decision in one go but mull it over after research and after perhaps seeking advice from different sources and comparing that advice. Even if, in the case of investment,  you are required to assess your own appetite for risk on a scale of 1 to 5, the final decision you make will involve considering a range of different factors with your adviser. To give just a few of such factors: 

Firstly, risk in finance involves not just considering the loss of your investment stake but also the risk of not achieving your investment objectives. What those objectives are may involve detailed consideration both of your own lifetime goals and also the interests of your dependents.

Secondly, there is what has been described as emotional intelligence. You will want to pay attention to what feels emotionally right to you when making a decision of this magnitude. To take a purely hypothetical example, if you’ve personally suffered from risky decisions made by members of your family, you might want to keep a cash reserve that is risk free, even if it will be subject to depreciation. 

Thirdly, you will be looking at ways to spread the risk: perhaps unit trusts, perhaps splitting your money into sections with a small amount invested at higher risk. You will be using diversification in some way to spread that risk. 

Fourthly, you will need to consider the downside of lower risk investments such as bonds: depreciation of the real value of your capital in view of inflation. 

Fifthly, if your investment adviser only offers you five horses at Newmarket, it doesn’t mean you have to put your money on the horse with the best odds or the best track record. You can always say you’re not prepared to invest your money that way (and find another investment adviser).

Three centuries ago there were a couple of dozen sects, many of which preached democracy, religious freedom, votes for all adults, land for all, equality for women and much else that we were later to hear in more erudite form from Marx et al. But all have disappeared, persecuted out of existence or slowly destroyed by a whiff of prosperity.

The reason I think there is validity to this is that I lived for several years in Japan. I lived alone there and was not allowed to keep a pet. Although I am an introvert and enjoy spending lots of time alone, after being socially isolated there for many months, there was a distinct change in my well being. I believe there was even a change in my brain chemistry. This was greatly relieved by a vacation among friends and family back in the U.S.

And I agree with her that resilience also depends to a large extent on our relationships with others. Last year when I suffered a spinal fracture and could do very little for myself, it was friends who really came through for me. ",2016-11-15 21:32:39 UTC,3,,,,

In the majority of Western nations, we have been conditioned to believe that our wants and desires are actually needs (as in, essential to our existence) in order to encourage us as consumers. Of course, it is not in the best interest of capitalist countries to satiate their people, because then consumption levels will drop. Instead, something new and intriguing/novel etc will come out, thus creating an unhappiness with our current possessions. If we are to try to achieve happiness in some way, then it seems to me that we need to educate ourselves to discern what is the difference between want and need. If I am continually depressed because my life seems so empty compared to my neighbour, who seems to have everything, then perhaps I need to start self-reflecting - do I have shelter? Do I have friends/family? Am I hungry? Am I healthy?

Well-being measurements are based on more than just self-reported happiness, anyway. In the UK, to measure personal well-being, the Office for National Statistics asks four questions (to be answered on a 1–10 scale): 
    1. Overall, how satisfied are you with your life nowadays?
    2. Overall, to what extent do you feel the things you do in your life are worthwhile?
    3. Overall, how happy did you feel yesterday?
    4. Overall, how anxious did you feel yesterday?

The perception of happiness is not like the perception of weight, or size, or brightness. The perception of happiness IS happiness. We may not be able to describe in words how we're feeling. We may struggle to rate it on a scale of 1 to 10. But happiness is simply what we feel. There is no external something that we are perceiving. There may be an internal something, but that's not what happiness actually IS. It may be a consequence of lots of different bodily changes, surges in levels of various hormones in our bloodstream. But those hormonal changes do not define happiness. If we say we are happier today than we were yesterday, it doesn't matter if our levels of dopamine, seratonin, oxytocin and norepinephrine (or whatever) are all actually lower than they were yesterday.

A good example is an example used in this video. If we have two bottles of wine, one low-priced and one medium-priced, we would choose low-priced; and if we have one unreasonably high priced, we would choose medium-priced. So, this actually confirm that values are hierarchical and hence 'mind is deep'. 

Comparing low-priced and medium-priced bottles of wine is done on a dimension: cheaper - expensive. Introducing unreasonably high priced bottle change that dimension into a higher order generalization: reasonably priced - unreasonably priced. When that dimension is activated, we would be released of any doubt about whether buying medium-priced bottle would be unreasonable; we would place buying medium-priced bottle under 'reasonable'. 

So, there are two hierarchical levels in this example. Even that is enough to infer that mind is deep. Further investigation of values would show that mind is very much deeper.

I like the concept of 'opportunity cost'. Everything we do should be measured in terms not of an absolute value (as you say - no such measure exists) but in terms of what we might have done with the money or time instead.

For example if studying a MOOC with Future Learn one is dedicating a certain amount of time and effort that could be used for something else. In my case I am thinking at the moment of various household chores that I should be getting on with instead! And then there is that 'long-term' project of clearing out the garage and disposing of a life-time's worth of broken coffee makers, old computer cables (now redundant) and other bits of stuff that might come in handy etc. etc!

At a certain point my pleasure in following the course will be overridden by my sense of guilt at leaving things undone and that is the true cost of my study rather than a one-off monetary value that really has (as you say) no absolute meaning.

Well-being is not equivalent to happiness. In the UK, to measure personal well-being, the Office for National Statistics asks four questions (to be answered on a 1–10 scale): 

1. Overall, how satisfied are you with your life nowadays? 
2. Overall, to what extent do you feel the things you do in your life are worthwhile? 
3. Overall, how happy did you feel yesterday? 
4. Overall, how anxious did you feel yesterday? 
(https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/bulletins/measuringnationalwellbeing/localauthorityupdate2015to2016)

Even if we measure our satisfaction in comparison to that of others, and even if how we think we felt yesterday is relative, and just a snapshot, in the aggregate this is useful data.

And self-reported personal well-being is just one of the ten measures the ONS uses for national well-being. The others are our relationships, health, what we do, where we live, personal finance, the economy, education and skills, government, and the natural environment (https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/datasets/measuringnationalwellbeingdomainsandmeasures/sept2016/wellbeingwheelsept2016.pdf).

We have been asked to accept convoluted proofs from strange little 'experiments' that are fundamentally flawed and would be thrown out as unacceptable in Science 101, as being illustrative of mental flatness. That the 'human' animal brain did not develop into an accurate weighing machine or to differentiate between certain lengths or colours, merely and accurately reflects that it grew slowly to meet the needs of the changing human animal over millenia, but this is ignored. That it can adapt and fashion tools to cover these differences strongly suggests that the brain is anything but flat.
I cannot say I have enjoyed the learning experience offered by this course, as I suspect that it is not actually a course at all, rather a collection of experiments cobbled together as a cheap way for the University to engage with 100's of people, hidden inside, but offered as a course.

So in a medical situation discussing risk, any statistics quoted would come from the centre of the normal distribution.   But for a physician to say ""it's quite likely"" etc. is not helpful to the patient and is actually counter to any exact measurement or any statistic they may have. What the physician perceives as minor may not be minor in the patient's mind and broad generalisations do not help.  ""It's quite likely"" contains a number of hidden things like ""you won't understand"" or ""I don't really know"".

So, if we were constantly referring back to a past time/environment, we wouldn't perhaps be able to adapt so successfully to our immediate situation. The snap decisions allow us to calculate in the now in a variety of different and perhaps unfamiliar situations. 
I'm not too convinced about this coffee/cafe example, because you're not just buying the coffee when you go to a cafe, you're buying the service, the environment, the convenience, the variety of options etc etc and I think most people understand that situation, which is why cafes are still so popular. It's like buying a slice of comfort where you're made to feel at home - so two pounds or whatever isn't a great deal when you think of it in those terms. Same with pubs.

Well, this turned out to be harder than I was expecting. I looked at developed countries with relatively high rates of GDP growth, like Ireland, Iceland, Poland, Romania and Spain, and then looked at their scores in the World Happiness Report updates for 2015 and 2016, and they'd all gone up slightly. But it turns out I was looking at too short a timescale.

As Easterlin puts it: ""Simply stated, the happiness–income paradox is this: at a point in time both among and within nations, happiness varies directly with income, but over time, happiness does not increase when a country’s income increases. We are talking here about the time series relationship of happiness and income in the long term, usually at least 10 years, sometimes more. As we shall see, the short-term relationship is a different story."" (http://www.pnas.org/content/107/52/22463.full.pdf)

I've looked at the transcript of the interview with Rory Sutherland, and I can't find the words ""unstable"" or ""imperative"". I think ""imperative"" must have a special meaning in psychology, but I haven't been able to find out what it is. I thought the focus of the Rory Sutherland interview was more related to our tendency to make comparisons between things rather than judge them absolutely. What I'm not sure about is whether we have evidence for the unstable and *comparative* nature of the human mind, other than by observing how we judge the lengths or widths or brightnesses of lines, or the pitches of notes, or the weights of objects of different density. Human decisions tend to be vastly more complex. It isn't clear to what extent we'd use such comparisons when making them.

On the first point, perhaps it is a sense of satisfaction and contentment that matters more than what springs to mind when we speak of happiness. On the second point I can be very happy on a roller-coaster, whilst simultaneously anxious about each turn/dip (which ironically adds to my happiness). So should there be government policies to increase contentment, diminish anxiety and depression, or make us all have more fun? It seems that currently in the UK too much focus is on removing that which might make people anxious and depressed (welfare state etc), and not enough on policies that actively increase contentment. Cameron, for all his faults, was on the right track with his ""big society"" idea. Its a shame he seemed to forget about this so soon after becoming PM, as contentment usually rises when we undertake selfless acts, form positive relationships with others in the community and feel we are contributing to making the world a better place.

Although there are many factors that affect individual happiness, it seems to me that GDP alone probably has little effect on the normal state of happiness of a group (there is no change in the status quo) and if wealth does influence happiness then a more even distribution of wealth within a group is likely to have a far more significant effect on the happiness of individuals.

Yes, you know when you have an emotionally healthy existence with people who show you that you are loved - that's not just thinking that you are happy. This condition makes you happy whether you are living on Vanuatu or in Dubai.

So until everyone there reaches our level, the country will consist of happy poor and unhappy middle/upper classes.

It also gives the rise to the partially educated economic migrants who seeing us in their media believe that if only they could live in our country, then they would have what we have and then be happy.

Thanks for the response.  While I agree that political programmes in themselves don't improve happiness I do think that governments can provide the enablers to reduce unhappiness in some sectors of the population.  There is sufficient evidence around that suggests countries with less inequality in wealth, their people report higher levels of well being than those with greater inequality.  The overall wealth of the country is less relevant compared with other countries than the variations of wealth within a country.
Thanks also to David for his comments.  I don't agree that the proposals are knee jerk.  There is quite a bit of evidence out there that does support them within a country.  I wasn't proposing that we pay to improve public services in other countries.

Compound the situation with borrowing money ( expected to be only temporary ! ) and a dire situation may arise which will cost government agencies much money in resources.  Many hardworking people find themselves in such situations, not through laziness, fickleness,  alcholal drinking or any of the other weaknesses attributed to them by some who have plenty.  
Governments should pursue policies of good affordable housing for all, excellent free nursery education and first class education for all children.

Whatever he has done in his life (he is an electrical engineer & manufacturing consultant with the ability to extrapolate complex systems out into the future without losing the detail) he continues to approach things through the lens of monetary value.  He has learnt from me that there are other values whose lenses when looked through, strip away that focus and he has stopped imposing this way of thinking on me.

Before the course started, I was very comfortable with the notion that we have values and beliefs, and exercise control and judgement.  I still find that model makes sense to me, although am now toying with the idea that it's just a model - a way of explaining why we do stuff.  I'm wondering if, for most of our day to day, ""unimportant"" decisions, we don't have a well formed outcome in mind when we respond to a situation - a course of action springs to mind (the idea of a sub-conscious mind doing a rapid bit of review and comparison of similar situations, responses and outcomes seems reasonable) and a suitable response appears in our heads that, with hindsight, we attempt to explain through notions of values and beliefs, but is actually just a response that is consistent with our previous behaviour, and ""values"" and ""beliefs"" are just labels we've assigned to explain that?  I do find it hard to question why I do stuff without using words like values, beliefs, background, upbringing and culture.  Curious!

I recognise that academics are under pressure to maintain the many plates they may be spinning, but I had viewed the dialogue element of FutureLearn to be one of the most interesting parts of the package.

Part of the training was to taste and compare about ten flavoured waters with differing amounts of sugar added. You had to rate the sweetness on a scale of 0 (for plain water) to 10 for the sweetest sample. It's very difficult, once you have tasted a very sweet sample, to distinguish the amount of sweetness in a later one even if you rinse out your mouth in between.

Perhaps the improvements are so gradual over a long period of time that it's difficult to notice and assess the changing levels of happiness or perhaps our individual happiness rating is quite settled and unchanging, apart from major life changes.
When it comes to a government's assessment of achieving success, I think the rating should be more objective e.g. comparing those who have a home with the number of homeless, those who have never been to a doctor or hospital with those who have been a lot, people's relative earnings and so on. I remember being very interested when happiness ratings were first used politically but I understood the scepticism of some people since it is very difficult to account for in statistical terms. One person's happy day might be measured as unhappy by someone else.
Maybe, it's all just a smoke screen for the real situation and more time and money should be spent on changing things for the better rather than trying to measure success e.g. someone on a zero hours contract is likely to feel less secure in life and therefore less happy than someone with a guaranteed income.",2016-11-18 14:05:33 UTC,1,,,,

In fact, I had never used a telephone until I started my secretarial training at 16! I live in a village which used to have a shop/post office and a regular bus service. Because more people now have cars and access to a large supermarket only two and a half miles away, the village shop - which was a focus for people to meet and chat as well as to buy things and use the post office - had to close. The bus service went two years ago because not enough people were using it (it was subsidised by the County Council who lost their funding from central Government so couldn't carry on as not economically viable). This is not exclusive to us, it has happened in many rural communities and has the effect of isolating certain groups of people - not conducive to well-being at all, in my view.

I knew no houses with central heating, there were fewer cars, foreign travel was rare and possessions were simpler and fewer. I think the concept of relativity when we assess our situation applied then as it does now. It isn't consciously done, but I think it's part of the human condition to feel comfortable if we see that we are doing well in material terms and that feeds into our sense of happiness, in the  sense that we can't reasonably expect more. Now I know that's a simplistic comment really because it doesn't account for those with a need to accumulate vast wealth, but surely they're the exception rather than the rule.
As for happiness, I think some people are more predisposed to that condition than others, that there is no objective way of measuring it. If you are a basically happy person then it can be difficult to understand the opposite and vice versa. However, as I said above, relativity is the important/overriding

 In our class we had to wink and hold a pencil out with our right hand. The pencil had to line up with the corner of the room. Then you had to wink with the other eye and it looked like the pencil had jumped just an inch or two from its previous position. This was to do with the visual field and we had to draw an image of how the eye actually sees and how that image is interpreted (upside down in fact ) through the pupil and then on to optical chiasma next on to the optical nerve and then to our brain.

The person sees other people doing it in a very normal way and easily, but that does not happen for her and even though it does not even hurt her after all, she can't relate to it emotionally different. The outside and even her repetidly good experience with it can't change her emotion towards it.

They have more, because to serve the economic sector, they have been inundated with debt! Debt is not wealth and will never be. Debt is worry, fear, possible loss. In short a lifestyle based on empty! They believe they're living a middle-class life which it is not.
They live month to month. So they have more material things which they may enjoy but does not even belong to them. Therefore these pseudo wealthier people cannot be happier because they have a heavy emotional load which they know is always a threat.
This is why quantifying wealth based on debt cannot give a real result. That debt can distort the view and outcome.

But given this need for comparison, this doesn’t initially appear logically possible as everyone needs someone who is worse off than them. The simplest answer to this would be their past. If everyone can see that in the last few years their lives have got better, then they could all be happy relatively without having people who were sad. To make everyone’s lives better compared to what they were we need steady progress and growth. A government can aim to make that a reality by pursuing economic growth and scientific progress in a form that can be felt by the people. Thus government is right to pursue these aims as they are at the moment provided they can make the effects felt to their population.
I would argue that this isn’t be done at the moment as many people around the world do not feel better off than their pasts, hence the rise in the ‘good old days’ rhetoric that was used effectively by Brexiteers and Mr Trump.

Then you make conflicting remarks about the value of the garden then confuse this with the niceness of the area. Both can be reasons to purchase or reject a property.
If you buy a piece of land then build a house on it you bought the land because you liked the area. The garden becomes part and parcel of the property and the value of the land has been enhance because of the improvements you have made.
On the other hand you might buy a house with a large garden, build another house in the garden and be left with the house you like and a small garden, this having been reduced marginally in value and you have the profit of selling the new house with part of the land.

That may simply mean they have a deeper belief in thrift.

The body is a steady state system that does not like interruption, which is why it is so hard to break habits/addictions. But smart phones and apps, like computers, are also addictive.  The second aspect is that using an arm's length mentor whom you do not know allows you to not take responsibility.

Since the brain does not know what the absolute value is, there is no limit to what an individual will spend on an single item when someone really wants to have it.  I can give you a 'nice' Dutch example; 

At the end of the (Dutch) Golden Age between 1634-1637 we had an period of 'Tulip Mania' in The Netherlands. In this period a single tulip was just as valuable as an canal house in Amsterdam. When the market crashed in 1637 many speculators were bankrupted. It was probably the first economic bubble in history.

Q3. I was always taught that we only value what we measure, the trouble being we often end up measuring something simple to calculate rather than a measure which accurately reflects our hypothesis and either our perception or our reality or both can be distorted by what we decide to measure. Can we really measure happiness and how transient is it anyway? What should governments do?

-Overall I would say lives are getting better (though this does relate heavily to where you live e.g. life in Syria  or war torn countries is very miserable right now). And I go agree with the theory that the reason we are not reporting our lives as getting better is because we are thinking in relative terms.
-I do think that your perception becomes your reality. People perceptions can change dramatically even when their circumstances don't, and as a consequence their rating or happiness changes according. Therefore happiness is not determined by your circumstance rather your perception of that circumstance.

“Now, suppose we get another group of people, and we give them another set of options. And those options going from six to 10. So, these are all more risky and potentially have higher returns than any of the options that we've talked about before.

Now, according to any sensible view which says we've got intrinsic risk measures, an intrinsic sense of how much risk we're willing to take, almost nobody should choose anything in this set willingly. They should all say, crumbs, when you gave me one to five, I chose three or four or two. So now I've got a chance of taking six. No way. Six is way too much. So, they should not really want to choose any of these options. But if they have to choose any of them, they'll choose the least risky. They'll choose six.”

He is suggesting that the second group would have known about the first set of options which is clearly not the case, so I would assume they too would take the average between 6 – 10.

(If you don't agree about world-wide well-being then I would recommend this video by Hans Rosling:
https://www.gapminder.org/videos/dont-panic-end-poverty/ )

Of course the growth of Psychology and indeed Psychiatry since the time of Sigmund Freud is a great thing, but alongside it is the growth of an enormous industry in mental well-being and the tendency to diagnose mental illness in ever increasing numbers of people. Not surprisingly people carry across into mental ill health the assumptions they have about physical illness i.e. that they can be cured.

Many mental health conditions may never be cured although some can be improved with either talking therapies or drugs.

There is a growing movement in the UK where I come from, to demand 'parity of esteem' between mental and physical health when it comes to spending by the National Health Service. Right thinking people will approve of this but they should also realise that it will be very expensive.

There doesn't have to be a correlation between wealth and happiness, so the answer to this may be ‘yes’, but it may also be the case that societies could become happier but not richer. Sometimes increased wealth just leads to more worry.
2. Are our lives really getting better but, because we think in relative terms, we do not report our lives as being better?
If by ‘relative’ we mean relative to others around us now, this could be true. However, if I think of my life (in terms of income, stability, home ownership etc) relative to how it was 30 years ago, then it’s a definite ‘yes’. I daresay this would be the experience of many others as well.
3. Perhaps, when it comes to happiness, perception is reality. If we do not feel our lives are getting better, then perhaps they simply cannot be?
If the ‘better’ in this question means better materially, this could be objectively measured, and we may have to look at other reasons for our unhappiness.

I think you're missing the implication of the fact that this was an experiment with real pain and real -- but very small -- amounts of money.  Even if the experimental subjects were impecunious students (as they very probably were), the sums of money involved in the experiment would have been pretty trivial in the context of their overall finances.  They could all afford to walk away from the experiment with none of the money that they had been given by the experimenters.  If they had any sort of absolute scale of valuing the avoidance of pain then they should have paid the same amount to avoid the shocks irrespective of whether the experimenters had given them 40p or 80p.

My theory is that people rather like capitalism. Not pure jungle economics but what is delicately called 'the mixed economy'. They want Government to administer justice and defence and to provide a social security safety net, education and health (these last two because the market system is not the most efficient solution) and maybe not much else. We accept that taxation is necessary to fund these but suspect that our taxes are wasted along the way. I have hardly ever met someone who felt that they were paying too little tax. 

The problem with giving too much power to the government is that they will become corrupt and difficult to dislodge. Zimbabwe would be a good example.

Would I choose to move into the world my parents experienced, without central heating, labour-saving devices, communications technology and so on? No, I am accustomed to my world. I might adjust quite quickly, but my knowledge that I was missing out would be a source of continuing discontent.

So we are running to stand still, aspiring to have things to which we quickly adjust once we have them, returning to a self-reported level of happiness which is perhaps more determined by psychological and cultural factors than by economic factors. But do we also adjust if we see ourselves as falling behind, as others acquire what we can't afford? Or do we become discontented and unhappy? Perhaps we adjust more easily if those around us also seem to be falling behind some more remote comparator.

What should governments measure? GDP is notoriously flawed. Complementing such economic data with information about feelings of well-being and life satisfaction, and health, and taking this information into account in formulating public policy, seems desirable.

nevertheless, here are mine...:
Of course we are all unique, shaped by our experience, and up to a point, by our genetic make-up. 
We shape and re-shape our thinking, therefore our very selves continuously.  We have to be more or less consistent with former selves to survive in a society - the more legroom we have the better life we have.

In the middle-ages we had less chance to become other than what was expected by our close social and physical environment - this has become a bit better, but there is a long way to go before all of us can become really free ""mind-builders"" - this would suppose for start, the opportunity of life-long learning for everyone.

It has become trendy to look for particular ""identities"" and over-concentrate on these - such as nationality, gender, physical attributes etc etc.   I think the more types of roles we can ""play"" - the more identities we are happy with, the more environment we can cope with/enjoy, the better.

It was simply that money is, by its very nature, relative. It makes no sense to suppose that, to a particular subject, avoiding the shock was ""worth"" 20p. It's not meaningful. It wouldn't come naturally to me at all to measure my desire to avoid pain in monetary terms. But if I were forced to, coward that I am, I'd probably pay a lot more than 80p, if I had it. The 20p is only meaningful in relation to the amount given to the subject for the purposes of the experiment. It doesn't matter whether they're impecunious or affluent. They don't have the option of using their own funds. The value of the money paid is limited by and thus will vary in relation to the total money the subject is given. After all, the subjects are not expected to say that avoiding the shock was worth £1.75, or £35, or £200. 

So it's either a flaw of the experiment that the money the subject was willing to pay to avoid the shock was used as a proxy for the experienced intensity of the shock, or, if the conflation was deliberate, the experiment has been presented to us misleadingly.",2016-11-21 21:36:24 UTC,0,,,,

As the level of wants and what people are willing to sacrifice for it will vary from person to person, it will also vary what the opposite side will offer and what they will ask for it. Greed is equally variable. If we bring marketing into play though the story becomes very different. Our wants and affordability are not at all controlled by market mechanisms. People easily buy beyond what they can afford because of the introduction of credit cards. So in my opinion markets do not give us what we want. Modern more complex products come with features that are focused on the want of a few but the rest pays lots more for useless add-ons.

What pattern of responses is most likely? Though it's after reading the answers quite obvious which direction to think my initial response was I think more based on the gravity of the issue. I think I was leaning to road deaths because it seemed by number a much bigger problem then the train death and therefore deserves more attention. Of course after rationalizing to have a preference for either makes no sense but it does shed another light on the example I think.

1. Advertising can reduce the cost of goods by increasing the demand and so reducing the unit cost. Actually in my business we spent very little on advertising and relied on word-of-mouth and repeat business. But for a company that wants to grow or that has a new product to sell advertising can benefit the customer.
2. We are all sales people. Everybody has something to sell their labour or their suitability as a partner / father / child / student. The only person who doesn't live a 'transactional' life is a hermit living on wild honey in a cave! The thing is that some people are better at selling than others.
3. Equally we are all middlemen. In my trade I used to meet a lot of people who liked to describe themselves as independent travellers. I used to give a talk about this that I illustrated with a cartoon of someone hollowing out half a tree trunk to make the boat to cross the English Channel (I live in the UK).

However this course is concerned with the psychology of individuals choosing houses within that market, rigged or not. From that point of view the video becomes more interesting because the oddities of our preferences are well known but often lost in the clamour and politics of housing.

Coffee in a cafe could also be misunderstood. The price of the cafe coffee reflects the cost of providing it - rents, staff, taxes etc. That misses the psychological point though - for some reason we put a value on that coffee which is out of all proportion to the coffee we have at home.

Taking a wider view of this, we are often asked to choose between political options of left and right which many people know is misleading. But we seem to be stuck with it and that in turn seems to restrict the possibility of deeper and wider political engagement.

“And this is quite serious news, because it challenges the idea that your risk preference is a sort of stable, individual difference, perhaps like introversion or extroversion might be in your personality. And instead it suggests that how much risk you take in any given moment can be buffeted around just by the numbers that you happen to have in mind.”

I can't really say whether the world is a happier place.  That people are in the main better off materially does not necessarily equate to being more happy and unlike relative wealth, happiness cannot be measured objectively.  If one compares one's  standard of living to that of a generation or 2 ago one may feel happy that they live now rather than then but that does not mean they feel happier than the people who lived a generation or 2 ago.  There is no way of comparing the two other than perhaps anecdotally which is hardly scientific.  The emphasis we now give the economy as a barometer of how we are as a society is unfortunate.  It would be preferable to devise criteria that gives a broader and more balanced understanding of our happiness and well being.

But the message I am getting is that authors are 'inventing', 'making up' presumably with 'cognitive effort'.  I am sure some do.

I suspect this author has relinquished analysis and the rules of 'ought' 'should' and 'must', and so it just pours forth from his sub.con archive.

The sub.con gives you stability because it is survival savvy.  For starters, the body and therefore the brain, is a steady state system.  But the brain is plastic and you can store stuff in there that runs you into trouble and if you are unlucky you can tread the path to mental illness.

It is also nonsense to say that there is no success if you change goals.  People do so and I think you need to define the term 'success'.

What is missing in this idea of personality is that it is not a simple little box, or worse a 2 dimentional flat thing, is that personality has a physical element.  Energy levels affect the expression of personality.  Some people think slow and others fast.  Chemical balance affects personality.  There are even rules inculcated in childhood that restrain personality (and behaviour) - determining how much you can let go or button up.  So to my mind this is all too simple.  

Then in the last paragraph, there is a description of what I would called brain integration (courtesy of sub.con) which kind of contradicts all the flat stuff.

What you are referring to are advances in technology. The cost of the first moon landing was 25.4 billion US dollars, or about 150 billion dollars in 2015. It has been estimated that with the new technologies the cost would be 14 million dollars. In 1970 the cost of producing a megahertz of power was $368,000.  As of 2007, it cost 34 cents and this would be even less in 2016.

There is so much wrong with the way advertising is thrust down our throats and the stereotyping of what we should do and how we should look. Such negativity overrides what advertising should be about, which is to inform customers factually about new products and the cost of buying the product.

In which case how would psychologists and designers respond to new information which challenges their behaviour when that behaviour is their working paradigm?

Of course there are. It may begin as a benign tyranny but how does it stay benign unless the designers are also subject to behavioural controls when we bear in mind that “information alone is not enough to change people's behaviours.”

When we're dealing with unknowns, we often resort to non sequiturs and other fallacies. For example, people know that bacteria are germs that causes infections. They also know that bacteria can be treated with antibiotics. Some people, when they have an infection, assume that that infection can be treated with antibiotics, even though it’s viral, not bacterial. And people frequently make judgements about entire groups of people on the basis of just one person from that group that they have met. Many people often assume that because a certain event happened after they made some change, then that event was caused by the change. And yet, if they were asked a simplified question in a lab: “B happens. Then A happens. Did B cause A?"" they may well be happy to admit that they don't know.

This appears to be a statement of fact but surely it is only the opinion of an individual endeavouring to prove that which is not provable. If the mind is flat does this mean that it’s a flat line? 
Well it can’t really can it? If it was a flat line the line would have depth but we are told that the mind does not have depth.  If the line had depth, how deep is it? If it did not have depth the line would be invisible.  
But the mind is invisible anyway so how can we discuss the structure of something that is intangible – difficult for the mind to grasp. Rather like discussing the soul, another intangible figment of the imagination, or trying to prove that God exists. We have minds, we have souls and some of us have faith but they are all intangible. You can have a heart transplant but you can only concentrate your mind when trying to understand your soul and your faith, even if you do so from the bottom of your heart.

On termites:- ‘’they don't seem to do any hard thinking. It's hard to imagine with such a small brain that they could.’’ continues the discredited idea that brain size is linked to intelligence. On that basis blue whales and elephants should rule the seas/land respectively.
Or careless language :- put a termite from one colony into another elsewhere and apart from inconsequential things like scent/smell it will continue as normal. No it will be killed as it is not of that colony! (even if we did get the gist).
This is followed by 2 sections on society and language which are frankly surreal. Language is very ''easy'' - stated in a country with one of the greatest inability to learn foreign languages. 
My daughter told me that not only does a foetus highjack the mother's body it also affects her brain, making it easier for her to learn languages, such as understanding a baby's gurgling. It makes more sense given the fairer sex's apparent ability to learn other languages, though the I cannot validate the idea.

Despite 4 decades of increasingly gruesome advertising and massive taxation, smoking has not gone away.

Then look at who joins them. Nurses, clinicians, and auxiliaries - all those who witness the horrible effects day in/out. 
Unless my eyes deceive me there has been a huge rise in young females taking up smoking, and tobacco company shares are flourishing.

I'm in my mid-thirties and there is a vast difference to what children have nowadays compared to what I had only twenty years ago. Just think about the amount of toys, phones, Ipads etc they have. I think a richer society also brings with it unrealistic expectations and desires. The need or desire to want something and get/buy it now, the sense that at school/university you are told you will be a success, only to start working and realising that in two years you will not be a manager. Maybe it is not only a richer society, but also a modern society where we are connected 24/7 allowing us to constantly compare our lives with other unrealistic (and often false) expectations. 

There are times when I stop and think back to another decade or compare what my parents had and I would say there are many reasons to be happier. We just need to decide what is important to us, regardless of money.

Politics constantly reminds us of the Easterlin paradox, at least here in Australia where surveys report a belief in the electorate that 'things are getting worse' while objectively there is low inflation, improving house prices and historically low unemployment.  The electorate has become very polarised with people voicing a tragic vision of the future which is hard to reconcile on any objective measure.
The ambivalence I feel over the use of the terms 'deep' and 'flat' in the context of mind and decision making is that while I accept that decisions/choices are made in a  relative/comparative way rather than reflect absolute beliefs, I think that our decisions are to some extent guided by principle or fit into a paradigm of beliefs.

I need a policy to cover the mortgage. €10 per month.  Then he tries to sell me illness and mortgage cover at €40 per month.  I said no thanks.  My brother, who is also my accountant had told me to build up a big wad of cash in the bank.  To cover illness, problems with the car, downturn in business, whatever.  So obviously I need that €30 a month to help build the fund.  So I just sign up for mortgage cover.
That's all well and good as long as I save the €30 a month.  But unlike you,  I can eat ice cream at any time of year.  I will be ok as long as I don't meet any ice cream salesmen to tempt me with exotic flavours. I might overdo it on the ice cream and be ripe for selling illness cover to in a years time.

- what was that about ""theories are right by definition"" ? Have they been confused with axioms? Theories (in science) need proving by experiment, they are predictive, until what they predict does not happen, they do not become accepted.
Their validity does not depend on one's ""philosophy of science"", but exactly on their predictive interaction with reality.

- science - even dentistry, (though that comes more under the technomogy label in my book) - have to be predictive.  Otherwhise how you test the validity?

I agree that the amount that the experimental subjects could pay to avoid the electric shocks was limited to what they had been given by the experimenters; i.e. 40p or 80p.  However, if you look at the results --- which are shown at about 6:40 in the video presentation --- none of the experimental subjects paid more than about 31p to avoid the shocks.  So the limit of 40p or 80p didn't come into play in practice.

In the experiment, the amount of money that the subjects would pay to avoid the shocks wasn't being used as a proxy for the experienced intensity of the shocks.  It was being used as a measure of the value that they placed on avoiding the shocks.  A key result of the experiment was that the value that the subjects placed on avoiding the shocks was (strongly) influenced by the amount of money that they had been given ........ even though both amounts were more than enough to cover what the subjects were willing to pay.

In everyday life we all have to make judgements about how much we're willing to pay to avoid pain or discomfort.  Do we take a taxi to avoid a tiring walk?  Do we pay for (more comfortable) first class train seats on a long journey?  Etc.  Etc.",2016-11-24 21:01:56 UTC,0,,,,

I agree with the implication of the difference between £1,000,001 and £1,000,005. If I am correct, in percentages 4 out of a 1,000,000 is just 0,0004% so it's negligible. 4 out of 5 is 80%. So when it comes to percentages there is a big difference.

But theoretically if we were the girl, we might put all the reasoning for that action to the departure of the boyfriend after the fact but the question would be that how much of it was a direct impact from that event? Could there be any other factors that contribute to the action then? How can we quantify it?

What happens is that I am no longer choosing between cars I ended up with in my choice, (one won on a 'fuel consumption' dimension, and other won on a 'price' dimension).

Larger value items however will require a slower mind and time to try and make as informed a decision as I can in terms of comparing the different aspects of the product. If the internal discussion returns a “want” and not a “need” then I really have no problem making the decision as I understand that I am going to derive pleasure from the purchase and as long as I don’t have to borrow money for that pleasure then I go ahead with the purchase.

I am always interested in the human/psychological element to such things. The philosopher, Alain de Botton, in his book 'The Art of Travel' writes, ""If our lives are dominated by a search for happiness, then perhaps few activities reveal as much about the dynamics of this quest...than our travels...The underlying problem with travel, of course, is that you can never actually escape yourself.""

more neural connections - and when successful - there is feed-back to further collective action and more success in survival.

so all those who deny the possibility of a collective, democratic society due to some selfish ""human nature"", are wrong in my opinion, as humans, first of all, are social. cooperating creatures.

The same goes for competition preventing people from getting taken advantage of. What Mr. Harford apparently doesn't realize, is that nearly all business and financial deals start out as interpersonal relationships. When people shop around, they don't chose the best product to the most advantageous conditions, what they really chose is a business partner they like and who they feel they can trust. Price is only a secondary consideration unless maybe you only shop anonymously on the internet. So once people made their choice, they tend to be loyal, even in the face of obvious disadvantages incurred at the hands of their business partner. I imagine they don't like putting their own judgement for choosing wrong under scrutiny, and rather make up excuses, why 'this time' the deal wasn't as good as it should have been.

As to being risk averse in good times and giving risk the preference in bad times, it seems to me that that's a simple and well proven survival strategy. Let's say you stand next to a deep chasm. If everything is going well, you'll try and stay clear, because there's no good reason to put yourself intentionally in harms way.

I suppose social sharing and cooperation are  learned skills with  built-in capacities for it like for speach and reading.

Some of these built-in capacities are missing in animals, though there is some continuity, the evolution seems quite clear - the cooperation and ""altruism"" worked in favour of human survival and further feed-back developed further intelligence.

I decide which one I like best, based on comfort and the way it looks, mainly. I know which extras I want in advance because I've thought about it. I ask a price and if it seems reasonable compared to other cars I've seen advertised I agree to buy it. I know absolutely nothing about cars, nor am I the least bit interested in them. I love the looks of ridiculously expensive cars I can't afford so I buy something I can afford.

Also, our behaviour is influenced by environmental factors which are missing in a lab setting.

If I bought something for £200, believing I had got a good deal, to then find out a friend had purchased the same item for £150 - I would then believe my deal wasn’t so good. On the other hand, if I bought the same item once again for £200, believing it was a bad deal, to then find out my friend had purchased it for £250 - I would then believe my deal was good, which doesn’t make any sense as I have paid £200 for my item on both occasions.

Because the market basically sets the price.
When buying a big item, such as a car, I will sit down with pen and paper and try to figure out exactly what I want and am willing to pay for it.

Consider driving, most of us set off and get from A to B safely but we have usually navigated a number of difficult road situations and unexpected hazards along the way, we even change gear and steer smoothly.
If our minds were flat I suspect we would drive like learners on every trip, continually surprised by each new bend in the road, every road sign and stray cat and cooking up a hand and foot response that might help but never being totally sure.

I have always had a problem with the idea that I should 'get in tune with my authentic self' as many therapists avow. How can I possibly know what that is if this self is deep in my unconscious mind?! They state that you will instinctively know what feels right, and seem to imply that it is our knowledge of ourselves making it so, whereas I think Nick is saying that it is likely to be our feeling of what others think we should do which makes it feel 'right'.  I agree with Nick that we all make up stories and that we do access memories and experiences, and modelling from significant others and social norms is a huge influence. Do we have stable personalities?  Well, I think that kids are born with a specific temperament, and their experiences determine their underlying tendencies (we do what we think we should). However, these personalities can change dependent on context and the role we are playing. If we lived alone on a desert island, would we have a personality?",2016-11-28 06:47:08 UTC,3,,,,

I now know not to bombard him with too much at once or he feels overloaded and confused.

I agree with the points made below about conformity but worry about the negative aspects. One example is the power of social media to influence by setting a false normality, especially among social groups. When a Facebook member 'shares' some populist nonsense about certain ethnic groups committing atrocities, or whatever, then the thousands of 'likes' and 'shares' are powerful, affirming and self-propagating....even though it might be vicious bile spewed out by a vested interest group.

So laboratory experiments may reflect behavioural mechanisms which seem irrational or even foolish because the social context has been distorted or removed in order to control variables. It fits the overall psychological schema.

The crow exploit is interesting too. It fits well with the difficulties we have in making absolute assessments. We are impressed by the crow bending a piece of wire to make a lifting tool but do not really know how to compare that achievement with the thousands of things a human can do but a crow can’t. Digging ore out of the ground, making it into steel and forming the steel into wire for example.

Yes, the ""meme"" theory is a metaphore - and about as useful as a metaphore can be in explaining the stability - and evolution, of human culture. 
Surely the big difference must be the ability of quicker adaptations to new circumstances. 

This seems to go back to the marketing dilemma of advertising something as well-known, reliable, or advertising it as something new. The interesting thing is, that humans - often, though not often enough - are interested in new things, even if there seem to be no environmental pressure to be curious about a particular thing. Only the communication, that somebody else is interested in it.  

So in fact a religion or a dogma that forbids inquisitiveness outside its tenets must be 
- like forbiding children/adults to have access to alternative information - is a very regressive feature for humans, while such ""stability"" might serve animals...

I wonder if the level of intelligence - as far as it is possible to measure it - can be linked to the level of curiosity towards newer aspects of environment (reality). We know that in animals this curiosity tend to mean ""higher intelligence"".",2016-11-28 21:56:42 UTC,1,,,,

It's almost as if we are explaining to a small child seeing and experiencing things for the first time, the reasons why they are doing things, feeling things etc. Do we tell ourselves these stories to justify making decisions and taking certain actions?

Perhaps Mary could tell herself another story such as John doesn't have any money and try not to assume that he just doesn't like her enough to buy her a present (there's more to friendships than material goods, Mary). Perhaps John could get creative and make her something which costs him his time rather than money, write her a poem, bake her some cookies, make her a lovely card or picture, or just spend time with her.

- Just because language is an unconscious, accidental, evolutionary construct , same as society and culture, doesn't mean that it cannot be consciously changed, when its rules are discovered.  
Same as adapting the natural environment, humans are also able to consciously change their originally random and un-known social construct, once its rules/patterns have been discovered.

In Hungary there was a movement at the end of the 18th century to revive the language as it was taken over by the ruling Hapsburg's German. Kazinczy made up using Hungarian rules of grammar cca 1000 new words - and I cannot fathom out how, but managed to circulate them so successfully, that lots of them become undistinguishable part of the language. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferenc_Kazinczy

“So, actually, I think you could think of human behaviour as surprisingly close to creative writing.”

One of the most interesting aspects of getting older is how it becomes easier to be non-attached in Aldous Huxley’s sense. Things are as they are, there is no point pretending otherwise. 

Viewed as a story, “The Mind Is Flat” unfolds chapter by chapter and one finds many elements of it are not unfamiliar. It adds new knowledge but nothing to send a mature personal philosophy in an entirely new direction. As explained in the video, stories organise what is already there. In my view this one organises it very well.

It seems though that the psychologists are striving, sometimes in vain, to define a model or simple explanation about what is going on when we make these kinds of choices and I think therein lies the danger i.e. the paired down examples simply don't reflect adequately what is going on.  An analogy is economists' attempts to define how aspects of economics work.  Steve Keen in Debunking Economics has shown how, like psychologists, they have created models to explain how the economy works that are shot through with assumptions that even the economists admit don't reflect adequateley the real world.  Nick mentioned a choice between coffee - made in a decent machine at home - versus tap water or milk.  Why would we choose the coffee when it is so much more costly (and more effort to access) than the water or milk?  The answer for most of us is probably caffeine!

Just as there were successful conscious interventions to language-reforms, when there was - it seems - a popular need for it so can chaotic and destructive market-forces overstepped into a planned economy. 
Your counter-examples involve totalitarian ad-hoc planning. With democratic share and control and our now much better developed literacy, science and technology, especially communication, we can build a conscious construct - first time ever - for human satisfaction, and not for random profits.

However, there can be general patterns drawn, as human physical and emotional needs are fairly universal.  So causing pain, hunger or other discomfort tend to be bad.  Restricting freedom - such as movement, access to information/education ditto. And if we'd live in a global democracy we could together figure out what other ""badnesses"" are there that a decent society wants to minimise.

So yes, we can judge a given society how it measures up to such collectively set rules.
If they eat each other, they have human-sacrifice, women/children denied access to education/information about alternatives, if there is a totalitarian rule - whether benevolant or not - etc etc. we know that it is probably, ""bad"".  
The question is, what can or should we do about it.  In my opinion, all we can do is offer education, and resources for education, and unfortunately, no short cuts. ",2016-11-30 17:12:43 UTC,4,,,,

Having said that I often wonder to what degree we are being influenced by our environment and the information available to us AND more importantly, whether we realise at all if we are influenced or we simply think that whatever idea/thoughts we have are all our own, they come from our (sub)conscious mind. What I mean is that sometimes I think it's hard to know if a thought or belief is mine or is it a result of outside influence that comes from parents, friends, colleagues at work, the media etc. Sometimes ideas, conceptions are so ingrained in us that we don't even consider them not being our own.

Partly, but I often rely on autopilot. For example, if there are three equally appealing courses on a restaurant menu then I may wait and see which one I blurt out when the waiter takes my order. This seems to work just as well as forcing myself to decide beforehand.

This detail had not been seen before and what he found was shapes and designs of antennae thatwe already used in our mechanical antennae.  What does this tell us?

Second the Reagan-Thatcher era, which actually proved that ""free market forces"" mean lots of subsidies for private business and cuts for social provisions.  Except of course for the enforcing apparatus of military/police/prisons/etc. And manipulated/monopolised ""competition"".

The liberal welfare states were also tried 50s/60s/70s -  there was a farer distribution forced on by higher taxes, I have the impression that people were happier then, felt freer and more hopeful for the future. Alas, if you leave the capitalist economic base - the unequal property relations - more or less untouched,  high taxation and regulation makes profits fall, and the profit-based economy grinds to a halt - it was called stagflation.

so the question is not libertarian or liberal; it is capitalist chaotic unpredictive economy that is leading again to crises, demagogy, fascism and war,  or a democratically owned and controlled collective and planned, therefore fairly predictable economy.  

Unfortunately we are not allowed to make a rational choice - as per usual, we were not allowed enough information about our choices in our very skewed not particularly democratic and open, education and mass media.

In this talk he says: 'You can only load up one clue in your mind at a time.' Now, as an enthusiastic cruciverbalist, I would disagree fundamentally with this proposition. 

Some people deliberately read all the clues before concentrating on any particular one. This is because they know that by putting the clues into their mind then elements of the subconscious mind will start working on them and when you focus the spot-light of your main concentration the answer will already be there because some of the (apparently non-existent) depths of your mind have been using spare capacity in your brain to work things out.

Another well-documented phenomenon is the fact that overnight your brain will continue to work on the unsolved clues. I have often woken up in the morning to find clues that seem totally unsolvable the night before are now glaringly obvious!

People don't choose the inferior option, but it affects which of the two other options they select.  For more information, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoy_effect.

So I suspect we should all learn to use consultants more, experts in searching out the best options for us.    The problem of course is bias, we are always suspicious.   Is the consultant helping us or helping themselves?   Have we put the right people in power?   So we try to do everything ourselves and muddle through by following the crowd because hopefully they have sorted it out!
On the plus side this strategy mostly works and we are happily unaware that we are making so many less than optimal choices along the way.

Then is it possible for an emotion such as anger to be perceived as sadness? When we encounter a situation which makes us angry, can a hormone make us feel sad? Adrenaline just heightens emotions, but he's making it sound as this piece of information is responsible for his theory. Adrenaline won't change our original emotion. Different hormones are responsible for particular emotions (eg. Dopamine for happiness), and I think emotions are triggered by these hormones. An example would be that different hormones can be injected in us to make us feel a particular emotion. We can't trick our mind into perceiving something unpleasant when dopamine is injected into us. Therefore I think it can be said that emotions are just given to us based on release of hormones, not emotions are what we perceive of them.

I got the message very early on - and wasn't new to me - humans are irrational, inconsistent and emotional and superficial factors making most effect on their decisionmaking.  This I agreed with to start with. 

However, this was pronounced as a ""human nature"" just as the unpredictability of the capitalist markets - something that is sort of innate and unchangable rule of the
world.

This I dispute vehemently; people can be made aware of the gaps in brain/psychological shortcomings, they can be taught logical and critical thinking. In my opinion that is the main difference from animal societies, we can study our past decisions, our history and learn more efficient decisionmaking.  

Consequently, we can also change the unpredictable, chaotic, randomly evolved, crises ridden economic system into an aware, well-informed, democratically controlled and much more predictable stable economy. ...",2016-12-02 08:22:12 UTC,2,,,,

Now you mention it, Nick seemed to be describing how our conscious mind works whereas, as you and Steve have pointed out, our subconscious mind can seem even more powerful. Various people have described the phenomenon, that I experience occasionally, whereby suddenly a breakthrough idea pops into my head, as if from nowhere, and certainly when I wasn't actively seeking it.  The typical scenario where this happens is in the shower or when I'm cleaning my teeth, when I'm relaxed and not really focusing on anything at all. Another variation of this is when I play tennis. Without a doubt, the best shots I play are when I'm not consciously thinking of anything. This phenomenon is well described in The Inner Game of Tennis by Timothy Gallwey.

Actually, Linda, you may form impressions of me from what I say, but it is best not to assume things.  If you had said, ""Do you assume that deferred gratification is always better than immediate gratification ""? I could have said that such was not the case and that there is a happy balance.

In science you measure weight and mass differently and explain the difference between them, but the mind does not really work the same way.  It looks at an object and attaches a number of attributes to it:

      How big is it (say it uses something similar to volume)?

     How hard is it ?

     Can I lift it ( a mixture of shape, holding points and heaviness)?

    Would it hurt me if it fell on me?

    Will it blow away/apart in a wind?

And anything else it wants to ask - bearing in mind it has only a microsecond to marshal all its references together before coming to a decision.

My mind is complex in what it can use to determine the weight of an item and it uses what science defines as weight as only one of its references.

What would you rather fell on you from 10 feet?  A pound of feathers or a pound of lead?  Don't tell me there is no difference, my mind know that there is - test it if you don't believe me.

In nature weight means can it be lifted?  Will it hold down an object in a wind?  Will it hurt me if I drop it on my toes?  It is not a physical measurement - it is how it effects me",2016-12-02 15:32:39 UTC,5,,,,

In addition your brain is keeping all your body functions - breathing, heart, hearing, seeing, etc. going - if it didn't you would die!

Your senses such as pain, heat, smell are also functioning and sending messages to your mind to protect you.

People would ring and offer to pay immediately if we waived the interest which was charged at only 5% per annum  (due to regulation).

Nick's point is that a house that's 'twice as nice' will tend to be twice the price, irrespective of whether it's in a cheap area or an expensive area.  That would seem a bit odd if you regard the 'niceness of the house' and the 'niceness of the area' as being separate items, each with its own value, in which case the combined value should be the sum of the value of the 'niceness of the house' and the value of the 'niceness of the area'.

Let's try a different example / analogy.  In a garden centre, there's a choice between a basic plant pot costing £10 and a decorative plant pot costing £20.
>>  Mr Smith buys the basic plant pot for £10 and buys a plant for £5 to go in the pot.
>>  Mr Jones buys the decorative plant pot for £20 and then goes to buy an identical plant.  He's charged £10 for his plant 'because it's going in a nicer pot'.
We tend to see that as being a bit odd --- and probably unreasonable.  Why should a plant cost more just because it's going into a more expensive pot?

First, I'm glad you're not getting stressed.  It's definitely not worth getting stressed.

Second, I don't think it's worth trying to unpick the exact words that Nick is using.  He's trying to illustrate ideas rather than give mathematical proofs.

Third, I'd like to have one more go at clarifying what I think Nick is getting at.  Suppose that I show you the estate agent's brochures for two houses on the same street, giving the floor plans, dimensions and lots of very detailed photos ...... but with the addresses blanked out.  We can even throw in virtual reality tours of the two houses if you like.  Now, I ask you to estimate the price difference between the houses ...... and I'll give you a prize if you get close!

Which would you find easier, bearing in mind that you don't know where the houses are located?
(1)  Estimate the difference as a percentage?  E.g. ""House A's price is 125% of House B's price.""
(2)  Estimate the difference in pounds.  E.g. ""House A would cost £50,000 more than House B.""

Nick's suggestion is that you would find (1) easier, which implies that the intrinsic amenities of the houses don't have an absolute value / price.",2016-12-03 19:55:48 UTC,0,,,,

(1)  The car choice experiment was investigating the process by which people went about making a decision, not the final decision.  Tracking eye movements showed the experimenters what information people were accessing in what order.

(2)  The supermarket experiment wasn't about people's attitude to risk, but was looking at how their perception of value was influenced by numbers / prices they'd recently been exposed to.

Although Neil Stewart didn't say it in quite this way, I gather that there was a statistically significant correlation between the number of prices in the range 50p - £1.50 on a participant's supermarket receipt and their choice of lottery.  Now, correlation does not prove causation, but Neil make it pretty clear that the explanation --- that the prices on the receipts were influencing the participant's perceptions of the values of the lottery prizes --- was a hypothesis rather than a proven result.",2016-12-03 20:48:15 UTC,0,,,,

If you are correct in your interpretation of Nicks suggestions then I would tend to agree. The absolute value depends on what the purchaser is prepared to pay.

There are as many reasons why one would want to buy a certain property as there are people. Most would be bound by what they could afford. Then within that restriction they consider how their furniture would look/fit in. Would their dining table fit in to the dining room. Are the bathroom and kitchen in good order, is the garden the right size, what is the outlook like. As with so many of Nicks assertions he appears to have picked them out of a hat, they so often seem unrelated to reality.

We are trying to measure something which defies measurement! This is the problem: creating a 'pseudo' measure which is imbued officially with reliability and rigour creates problems down the line because the basis for subsequent decisions is flawed.
I am a teacher. I believe that attempts to measure/quantify children's learning together with the use and abuse of statistics generated by those measures have a detrimental effect upon decisions made in education. In many schools, I believe, Years 5 & 6 are years of maths and English cramming. Children and young people across primary and secondary schools are being trained to pass examinations rather than to have their minds stimulated ...

I have mentioned my kade on the implications of quantitively measuring in education.
Perhaps, all we can do is pursue what we believe is logical, reasonable and compassionate, encouraging others to do the same, support those who seem to be guided by like principles and rely on checks and balance in our complex society.
Sorry, that doesn't answer the question, so, here goes:
If we acknowledge there is no 'absolute' standard measure, that we are just approximating - and bearing in mind the Easterlin Paradox, could we instead attempt to measure the amount of pain/displeasure?

For example, when a politician speaks of ‘we’, many of us may prefer to be excluded from that particular political ‘we’ but may have no real choice. 

Another example might be managers who say ‘we’ when he or she means ‘I’ or ‘the CEO’ or whatever.

Simple examples are fine for uncovering the mechanics of simple social interaction but in the real world individuals do not disappear from the social mix, especially powerful individuals and powerful groups.

When people were asked to tick what benefits they were entitled to, and then signed to confirm their answers were correct, they were less honest than when they were primed to be honest.  That is, in the control form they were asked to sign that the boxes they were about to tick were completed honestly, and then asked to tick which boxes indicated which benefits they were entitled to.  There was a significant decrease in the number claiming they were entitled to benefits - claimants were influenced to behave honestly by mention of the word ""honest"".

If, later, you're asked how you felt immediately after a particular experience, your mind comes up with an answer in response to the question.

That means that, when you're asked the question, you generate an answer by processing the available data (memories, experiences, etc.) rather than by retrieving a stored answer.

Too often people sacrifice the bottom bit for the top, even for the ""transcendental""...

Yes, there's definitely an element of people living ""the story of their life"" and constructing stories about who they are.  However, people do also have underlying traits and preferences, some genetically defined and some acquired through experience.  (As has been pointed out elsewhere in the comments on this section, very young babies have quite distinct 'personalities'.)

While people do, generally, wish to appear to be consistent, I am entirely unconvinced by your suggestion that we devote massive amounts of mental processing power to maintaining a consistent, integrated personality.  Do you have any evidence for this?

From an evolutionary point of view, our brains have had far more important things to do than ensuring that we have a stable set of values, goals and behaviours.  For example, during our evolutionary history, survival has depended on things like understanding the likely actions of other creatures --- in particular, other humans --- and the likely outcomes of our actions.

They show from early childhood. We often have no time to invent ourselves when we respond to stimuli quickly and in an instintctive way. Of course, there is socialisation, there are life expenriences, all modifying factors, but we gravitate towards that core set. So we're shy rather than outgoing, or aggressive rather than calm, and even when we want to change, we face resistance from ourselves.

I do notice that we invent and reinvent ourselves in many areas, such as habits, tastes, value systems, political or religious beliefs, we consciously learn to be more patient or think before we speak, but all that is in addition to that core. We have intuitions whether other behave naturally or artificially. And our carefully created facade can crumble when life becomes too much. So I would argue that under the changeable outer shell - what we say, how we dress, etc. - there is something more stable, which I would call personality. Whether it depends on genes, brain chemistry or other things, is another story",2016-12-06 12:55:01 UTC,4,,,,

>>  Once we're adults --- i.e. beyond our ""formative years"" --- our experiences only change incrementally unless, of course, we go through a particularly significant / traumatic experience.
>>  We tend to like to maintain a fairly constant self-image.
>>  In most cases, we tend to remain in similar, familiar environments for most of our lives.  Only a minority of people emigrate, change to a completely different career, etc.

So, sincce our behaviours emerge from sources that tend to remain fairly constant, our behaviours --- and hence 'personality' --- tend to remain fairly stable over time.

The point is not if most other people in their town had paid taxes or not. It is the fact that they sent out a statistic which most people could not check to make them change their behavior.  Note he did not say it was true, but how can you tell?  If it was true, can you guarantee the next time it will be?  Is he using statistics from one sector of payers (say all payers) talking to a different set of payers (first timers)?  If the later then it is a lie, i.e. not like with like!

That is why in courts the oath is ""to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth""

Once you know that people respond in this way, why not use propaganda to make them behave in a certain way = say to vote to remain in EU, or to leave?

This is entering dangerous waters and often you see how truthful statements are  distorted out of context to suit someone's particular point of view.  That is why I worry when Governments start to use these ""tricks"" to ""persuade"" people to do something ""for their own good, or the good of society""

We -thinking is crucial to society and culture if they are to be healthy and of benefit to all. We exhibit we-thinking to a large extent in groups which are not inclusive of all members of society.  The benefits which could, and perhaps should, arise from we-thinking become distilled as the group increases in size and limit boundaries appear.  Other groups form and provide norms and guidelines for their members.  Take an individual family;  it provides a safe, protected environment for its members; the wider relative group increase the common interest and security.  Local community is interested as a group in the welfare of all but starts to show widening divergence of ideas.  This is not necessarily a bad thing as it allows for cross fertilisation of ideas amongst people and we-thinking allows for change. I don't think there could be society without we-thinking.

What Tim meant by chess being a ""solved game"" is that it is, in principle, possible to define each player's optimum strategy for his next move for any possible layout of chess pieces ....... including the standard starting position.

This is because
(a) The game is finite.  There are only a finite number of squares on a chessboard, a finite number of chess pieces in the game and a finite number of moves that each chess piece can make.
(b) There is no hidden information.  Both players can see the positions of all the chess pieces throughout the game, and both players know what moves each piece can make.

So, in principle, you could look at all the possible sequences of moves and (i) define each player's optimum best move from any position and, therefore, (ii) predict the outcome of the game if each player follows the optimum strategy.

Suppose that two players --- A and B --- play a modified version of the ""paper, scissors, rock"" game in which the players make and display their choices sequentially rather than simultaneously.  That is, player A selects and displays paper, scissors or rock, and then player B makes his selection.  It's pretty obvious that player B's optimum strategy can be defined as
>>  If player A displays paper, select scissors.
>>  If player A displays scissors, select rock.
>>  If player A displays rock, select paper.
It's also pretty obvious that if player B follows this optimum strategy then he'll win every game.

In von Neumann's terms, this is a ""solved game"" ......... and there would be no point in anyone playing it!

As I said above, chess is also a ""solved game"" because, in principle, it would be possible to define the players' optimum strategies and to predict the outcome of the game if they followed those strategies.  Fortunately, it's completely impractical --- at least, at present --- to actually derive those optimum strategies, and chess remains an interesting game.

If you have previously built a few sheds and are now building a shed with someone equally competent, you may develop a way of working together without much verbal communication. But there would be some non-verbal and when it is obvious there needs to be verbal communication, we speak. If two people have been building sheds (or any complex task) together for a while this non-verbal co-operation may develop further. But two novices or an unequal pair are going to have to communicate extensively. 
Same goes with a lot of social interaction. You get to pick up on non-verbal cues from people you are familiar with, but are likely to need more verbal communication with strangers.

She could graze, and best of all, it had apple trees. So you wonder, if a horse is capable of ""we-thinking""? Consider the following.

After she had eaten all the apples on the lower branches, I wondered how I could make the others available to her too. Of course eventually they would fall to the ground, but then she just took a bite off the top, knowing that underneath, close to the ground they might be rotten. So I decided to stand on her back and just pick the apples to feed to her directly.

No, I don't think Nick's trying to say that the ability to communicate verbally distinguishes humans from animals.

He's saying that standard economic theories assume that each person is acting individualistically --- i.e. pursuing his or her own individual objectives, albeit taking account of other people's probable actions and responses --- and that this misrepresents a very important aspect of our interactions with other people.

Specifically, he's saying that in many situations people pursue joint objectives and that this enables / causes them to act in a coordinated way that is not taken into account by standard economic analyses.

I don't actually agree with him that this ability and willingness to pursue joint objectives and to view things from a joint (or team) perspective --- in his terminology, ""we thinking"" --- is particularly special.

Standard economic theory would say that I'm pursuing my objective of having a nice dinner and my wife is pursuing her objective of having a nice dinner.  Acting as individuals, we have to negotiate a way forward.  Of course, I'm aware that my wife wants a nice dinner and she's aware that I want a nice dinner, so it's not difficult to see how we --- while acting as individuals --- can come to an arrangement whereby we both contribute to the cooking process.

Nick's saying that the standard economic approach doesn't explain our ability to work together.  He's saying that I'd be trying to decide what I should do on the basis of predicting what my wife's going to do, and she'd be trying to decide what she should do on the basis of predicting what I'm going to do ....... and we'd get stuck in an infinite loop of trying to second guess each other.

I think the old adage of 'trial and error' and learning from one's mistakes underpins the development of shared understandings.  More complex tasks require more sophisticated communication especially where technical skill is required.  
To the extent that 'we thinking' is essential technologically, it is peculiarly human.  No realistic comparison can be made between the abilities demonstrated by humans and those of other species.

There would need to be controls in place so that each new born was subjected to exactly to same social systems as the other in order to see if both young developed similar or unsimilar thinking.    So you could do the classic Tarzan experiment but with no human interaction and do the same in reverse for a new born gorilla.    Of course this would be rightfully rejected by the ethics committee.

I suppose quantity jumps into quality after a good while - I think there was such a quantitative jump to Homo Sapiens from previous hominids when the capacity for speach, so the communication of memories - learned skills from previous generations - became possible. At this point the brain was big enough and ready. This capacity enabled humans to adapt faster, to make use all those zillion more connections coming in use. Language and collective work feed-back for more connectivity etc.

So in my opinion - of course we are animals, part of a particular species related to the others - but there is a qualitative difference that can be pinned down. T

There is a continuity in awareness, intelligence/etc, but I think in general, there is a big difference when you can pass on (all!) learned (not innate) knowledge
in just a generation by communicating.  When we can learn from mistakes not only by the tool of a long-lasting evolutionary process, but by thinking quickly.

Conflict theory as I understand it models human social relations as bring more 'us' and 'them' than 'we'.  Does 'we thinking' implicitly reflect an idealized society based on consensus rather than a model based on conflict. 

Karl Marx challenged the idealist interpretation of history with a conception based in materialism i.e. the social production, distribution and exchange of the material necessities of life which historically underpins the struggle between social and economic classes.  In a theoretical sense at least  'we thinking' would appear fundamental to class consciousness which is peculiarly human.

Although genetics do play a role in determining people's personalities, I think environmental influences are also very important ....... and during your early years your siblings are a very important part of your formative environment!

It's been pointed out elsewhere in these comments that siblings often have very different personalities, even though they've been ""brought up in the same environment"".  Well, I don't think it's true that siblings are brought up in the same environment because, for example, I was a very significant part of my brother's environment and he was a very significant part of my environment.

I think sibling's personalities often diverge because each is seeking his or her own distinct role within the 'family ecosystem'.  If an elder brother is very outgoing and extrovert, his younger brother may well develop a more introspective personality, thereby establishing his own unique identity and role rather than competing with his older brother for the ""extrovert"" role in the family's children.

Nick is arguing that we humans have a unique ability to think in terms of joint objectives and how to coordinate our actions to achieve those joint objectives.  He's calling this ""we-thinking"".

In order to demonstrate this we-thinking he needs to use experiments in which people successfully coordinate their actions or choices without talking to each other.  If an experiment allowed verbal communication then doubters could say "" Yes, the participants managed to coordinate their actions, but that was because they --- acting as individuals --- negotiated an agreed strategy.  It doesn't show that they were 'we-thinking'.""  Taking verbal communication out of the picture allows Nick to argue that the cooperation must have been due to we-thinking.

I should mention, by the way, that I still don't agree with Nick about we-thinking.  My view is that the coordination could be explained by people pursuing their individual objectives while understanding and taking account of other people's desires.  This is a remarkable and powerful human capability ..... but it's not ""we-thinking"".",2016-12-10 14:44:16 UTC,1,,,,

It is interesting that the majority choices were such large majorities. We are good at coordinating and I think that is due to cultural expectation and educational training. The way the pictures were selected almost forced you to pick one over the other three.

So the ability to coordinate doesn’t make humans distinct; instead, it’s the motivation behind it that makes humans distinct from animals. ",2016-12-10 17:15:33 UTC,5,,,,

I think the game itself is pretty clear.  You and I each have to select Hi or Lo, without a chance to talk to each other before selecting.  If we both select Hi we share a big prize.  If we both select Lo we share a small prize.  If one of selects Hi and the other selects Lo then we don't get a prize.

Okay, let's play.  What are you going to select?

Nick's argument is that your priority is to select the same as me.  The problem is that you don't know what I'm going to select.  You know that I'll want to select the same as you, but that doesn't help, because I don't know what you're going to select ..... and in fact you don't know what you're going to select.

Nick therefore thinks we're stuck in an endless loop of ""I want to do the same as him / her, and he / she wants to do the same as me, but I don't know what he / she is going to select and he / she can't deduce what I'm going to select .................."" and so on ad infinitum.

Nick's argument is that we circumvent that deadlock by switching out of thinking individually and into thinking as a team.  You think ""What we --- as a team --- want is to win the big prize.  What do I need to do to help the team win the big prize?  I need to select Hi.""  And so you select Hi.  Similarly, team thinking mode also leads me to select Hi ....... and we win the big prize.  As Aleksandr Meerkat says .... Simples!

Nick is suggesting that this ability to switch into team thinking --- or ""we thinking"" --- is something that humans are distinctively good at and that it's the basis for our social and cultural success.

Now, I'm not convinced by Nick's arguments.  You could explain our ability to solve the Hi-Lo game puzzle without invoking ""we thinking"".  For example:-
I have no idea what you're going to do, so I've basically got to select either Hi or Lo and accept that I've got a 50:50 chance of matching you and winning a prize.  From my point of view, a 50% chance of winning a big prize is better than a 50% chance of winning a small prize, so I select Hi.  By the same argument, you also select Hi ...... and we win the big prize.  No ""we thinking"" involved.

The difference being that Nature doesn't care and its creatures live with that.  Human societies spend an awful lot of time trying to avoid the consequences of Nature not caring.  No doubt that is how 'caring' for one another developed.  So if that is the case there must be values common to all societies - the early stages of Maslow's Hierarchy Needs describes these:  Physiological (food, water etc.);  safety;  belonging.  So the moral compass has to develop if you are to avoid calamities.  And the question, itself, is too simplistic to my mind, to be answered properly.

experiment I felt was a little contrived as it related to the card topic this week... where we will pick the odd one out if it means a prize.. so we had been conditioned to think that way and select on that basis. we knew the rule was to pick the odd one, not the one everyone else would (although everyone else would because that was the rule).

I have some strong reservations. Firstly even when animals are in direct contact with us humans, they are exploited to the enth degree. They're  therefore not privy to the interaction between humans. In the case of animals who are really part of a family, they rise above expectation in all  kinds of interactions. Children  found in situations of total abandonment are as underdeveloped as unskilled animals.
For instance, I never believed that a family of cats would not develop true bonding with their offspring throughout their lives. My family of cats have a huge family bond. They sleep together, show signs of continued affection and bonding. Generally animals are not
given the opportunity to do this. My cat is a loving caring mom when her litter was born. She only left them to go to the litter box. Therefore I don't  agree with the concept of there not being joint participation in tasks, in the animal world. I will say more - the male cat, when the mom left the cot,would jump in and stay with them until she came back.

My reasons for this are that I am struggling with the idea that if our ‘minds are flat’ then how do we manage with ‘we thinking’.  This appears to be a very complex thought process, in that I should be able to think not only about what I want to achieve in completing a task or in a conversation but also what another person is thinking, then conclude on what we want to achieve together when completing a task.  This to me seems far too complex for a ‘flat mind’ to achieve and instead demonstrates the very opposite.  I not sure if I have missed something, but before this week, I was happy to accept that the ‘mind could be flat’.
I am looking forward to the final week and hope that Nick manages to string it all together and makes sense of the whole course.  Either that or ask Jess to write up some notes which so far through this course I have found far more helpful than Nick’s lectures.

I am enjoying reading your thoughts and just wondered if you had spotted a London School of Economics study, conclusions of which have been headlining today?
One finding relevant here, echoing similar studies in recent years, is that more money in absolute terms has relatively little impact on happiness:

""On a scale of one to 10, the doubling of someone's pay saw their happiness rise by less than 0.2. The researchers said this was down to people caring more about how their incomes compared to other people's than how it affected them. 
However, having a partner saw happiness rise by 0.6 - losing a partner by separation or death saw the same impact downwards. ""

I couldn't help thinking about the 'flat mind' relative thinking model that Nick is presenting: it fits here. However, I still think, as I said in  earlier weeks, that it is secondary to the base layers of Maslow's ''Pyramid of Needs' i.e. Food, shelter, companionship etc...as this study once again shows.

Then you try to force people to take on that mindset, and we all know how successful that's gonna turn out to be.

People, flat mind or not, have all their own idea of how their environment should be. shaped or designed. If they are denied that vision, they will never be completely happy. And if they clamour for more planning, it's really nothing more than being fed up with the chaos they perceive. They assume of course that those plans will be drawn up with their mindset as basis.

Nick says ""when you're solving one problem ..... you can bring together lots of your background knowledge"" and he talks about ""funnelling the whole of your attention and knowledge onto one problem"".

The implication is that your mind does contain a very rich set (or ""deep pool"") of experiences, past decisions, knowledge of the outcomes of decisions, etc., etc.
So your mind is, in fact, not ""flat"" in any meaningful sense of the word.  However, I think a key point is that your mind doesn't process that rich set of data ""on spec"" and store answers in case they're needed in the future. It only processes the data in response to a question.

So for example --- as was pointed out in Week 1 --- your mind doesn't keep a comprehensive log of how you felt about every experience.  It just stores memories of the experiences.  If, later, you're asked how you felt immediately after a particular experience, your mind comes up with an answer in response to the question.

That means that, when you're asked the question, you generate an answer by processing the available data (memories, experiences, etc.) rather than by retrieving a stored answer.  And that's why your answer can be influenced by things that have happened since the original experience, and which couldn't have influenced how you felt immediately after the experience.

All this isn't totally relevant to the issue of cultural complexity, of course, but I hope it helps to clarify the question of what the term ""flat mind"" actually means.",2016-12-12 22:04:57 UTC,11,,,,

A key point is that natural selection acts in the ""interests"" of the genes, not the individuals who happen to carry the genes at a particular point in time.  I once heard our bodies described as our genes' survival machines.  I find that a useful way of looking at things ....... and it makes it entirely obvious that soldier ants are part of their genes' survival machines.  There's no reason why the survival machines should consist of a single part, and there's no reason why every part of the survival machine should be involved in passing on the genes.  After all, your legs don't play a direct role in reproduction --- that's left to your egg or sperm cells (depending on whether you're female or male).

My idea was concentrated residential/leisure/shopping areas in a green environment, segregated from industrial areas which should be reachable only by train for the workforce. Over time I realized that self driving, non owned cars on underground streets, like in Masdar City in Abu Dhabi could be a good complement to bring public transport right to everyone who needed it.

Not only has this vision stayed intact across decades, I also know how to construct the buildings, how to construct the electric cars, and I have a fairly good understanding of the workings of a train. I know how to generate power and how to get water to the people. I have a clear idea of how to drain it away again and how to clean it, to be used by agriculture.

The growth of discount supermarkets doesn't necessarily mean that there are a lot of people paying attention to prices.  It could just be that --- for a variety of reasons, including word of mouth, newspaper and magazine articles, etc. --- it's become a commonly-held belief that ""Aldi and Lidl are a lot cheaper than the more traditional supermarkets and the quality of their produce is fine"".  That would lead to a lot of people choosing to shop at the discount supermarkets, even if those people don't look carefully at the actual prices.

And of course, that trend will get strengthened as the stigma of going to discount shops fades away and it becomes almost fashionable to shop at places like Aldi, Lidl and charity shops.

By the way, just to be clear, I'm not making any statement about how many people actually pay attention to the prices.  I don't know how many there are.  I'm just saying that there's a possible alternative explanation for trend towards discount shopping.",2016-12-12 22:47:46 UTC,1,,,,

If completely different societies over time strive to attain the same goal, like equal justice under the law, which has been in the sights of different societies in the East as well as the West, as a valuable principle, one can assume that that's a desirable personal right to be guaranteed by the society. If on the other hand these rights are used in an opportunistic manner, one can fairly assume that the society in question is unjust. Case in point, the US used to teach in its schools that equal justice should be provided to everyone. Interestingly at all times, some foreigners were excluded. It castigated nations like Russia and China for not observing the principle, and shamed these nations on the international stage. Now we have suddenly the opposite situation. China for instance has a drive against corruption which reaches even into the highest echelons of the party, and seeks equal justice for everyone.

Fact is, there were NO CRASHES and NO INFLATION (except in time of war) before the Fed started manipulating interest rates, while the money belonged to the people instead of being held hostage by a private bank. I used to discuss this very subject with Kurt Richebaecher, former managing director of Dresdner Bank in the early 90's, and it was clear even then that the Fed, then led by Allen Greenspan, had complete control over the markets by controlling the money supply.

Everyone talked about the long term costs of cancer, second hand smoke, well you know the spiel. It was the same all over the world. Turns out that when you keep raising taxes, there's a sudden sharp drop in the number of smokers. Now guess where the government set the actual tax. No, it wasn't at the point that discouraged smokers. It was at the point that guaranteed the highest income.

Two.

there's no universal grammar, some languages apparently don't even have tenses and there's enormous variety in how languages 'segment' the world, but what matters is that humans are able to acquire languages, while experiments with animals learning codes/languages were only partially successful",2016-12-13 20:19:10 UTC,0,,,,

The reason why we're able to learn languages, social conventions, etc. is that we've evolved to be very good at learning such things.  From an evolutionary point of view, it's been extremely important to be able to learn how to understand, predict and influence other humans.  That has provided strong evolutionary pressure for humans to have the capability to learn to do those things.

We don't learn languages by getting a few fragments and then ""making a few wild stabs in the dark"".  Children learn their parents' language by observation and copying.  Adults learning a new language spend a lot of time and effort learning language structures (e.g. verb tenses) and vocabulary.

People are not ""utterly, hopelessly lost"" when they move to a new country, society or organisation.  They recognise that they need to learn about their new environment --- ways of doing things, societal norms, manners, who has the power to make decisions, where the canteen is, etc. --- and they usually learn very fast.

Stay home, which is what the old people did, take the one bus to the city which left like at 5:30 in the morning and returned at 19:00 at night, or walk about eight kilometers to the train station (railway station for Susan ;) ), where a train stopped about once per hour. We had of course a car. Kinda hard to pull a horse trailer without a car as well. If one of us was gone with the car, the other sometimes took the tractor to pick up stuff at the local store. I'm guessing that electric vehicles will take a hold in the cities soon, so you'll have something usable for the country in another 15, 20 years or so.

Thank you to Nick and the team for the course.

One last point I would like to make, and it is one that I touched on earlier in the course, is that I'm not sure that we can make general statements about how flat minded people are. The art experiment proved this; several people on the course were not swayed by what other people thought. The older I get, the more I walk my own path in life and don't just follow the herd. Perhaps people tend to be swayed because it is easier to conform than to do their own thing? Each to their own.

Human cognition is by far superior to other animals and this is what basically sets humans apart. Animals have evolved cognitive abilities that may seem quite sophisticated but these are limited to their needs for survival in their environment. Is your pet dog smarter than a wild dog? I doubt it. Your pet dog lives in a friendly environment and has learned, often with reward, through human actions (and instinct) to behave in particular ways. Wild dogs learn from older dogs in the pack (and instinct) how to hunt for survival. Although communication is required (hand clap or bark or movement of the older dogs) little thinking is involved.  The complexity of humans and of the environment they have created requires sophisticated collaboration to acheive objectives in a way not required by other animals. 'We thinking' enables humans to coordinate interactions for appropriate outcomes despite these complexities.

Cultural norms such as music and religion are important in providing the clues that Alex talks about to enable the human animal to 'understand' the social world.  Do they evolve in the same way Darwin proposes for the physical organisms? He seems to be saying ""sort of "" as I understand it. Certainly the complexity of society is really understood through analysis of it's parts and processes which really aren't apparent to the casual observer living his/her life.

I know the term was used by the early altruists, such as Bentham, but I thought that modern thinking focused more on 'well being', in a more rounded or holistic sense. I am no philosopher or sociologist, but my simple understanding is that this enables objective measurement and comparison. This would seem to take out the 'flat mind' flaw that Nick is focusing on.
I  find 'happiness' a difficult concept to pin down-as Have thinkers right through history. I gave up years ago and I have to say that I am much the 'happier' for it. My own belief is that contentment is a much better goal: it is more achievable and is actually a precursor to happiness...not the other way round.  Happiness is, to me, a bit of an elusive butterfly that is impossible to chase but best left to alight where it will, and enjoyed when it lands, but in the knowledge that it will come and go with the vicissitudes of life.

The thing that would alter-most likely increase- my liking of a particular work of art might be to learn more about its context,  provenance etc, not what the herd thinks of it.
Some of the experiments have been good but this was a little obvious and even a little  patronising. I would have thought it likely, and therefore foreseeable, that a group of people interested enough in learning to spend time on MOOCs might have seen a bit of art in their time and thought about what they like and what art means to them?

These can be overlaid  with the important utilities like education, freedom of speech, freedom of sexual expression...etc. They are all measureable whereas happiness isn't.

Much of the course was very enjoyable and thought provoking, particularly the elements involving Alex Kacelnik: he has opened up a whole new area of interest to me. I enjoyed Rory Sutherland-even in his smugness!- and have read and listened to Tim Harford before.
But, I felt it was too long and could be reduced to 4 or even 3 weeks without loss.
I was frustrated and puzzled by the total lack of interaction on route; I took this course along with two others: they were brilliantly enhanced by ongoing feedback, answers and guidance from course leaders and tutors.

Evolution is not 'designed' to produce an optimal outcome which to me equates to the notion that there is some omnipresent guiding hand (God/divine entity) that will deliver us to Nirvana. The idea is that efficiency is not so much essential to the maintenance of genes but that less efficient organisms will simply not be able to compete effectively.  There is no necessary moral ethic implicit in evolution though human minds will no doubt find one (that is to see things in nature evolving before our eyes and arguably nor can we cultural phenomena evolve in real time.  We see it on reflection, by comparing what was with what is.  The ideas expressed by Shakespeare are as relevant today as in the 16th century but we certainly I have great difficulty with the language Shakespeare uses however magnificent one finds it when one takes the time to properly understand it.  No person or group planned the evolution of the English language to what it is today but arguably it is more efficient (in a utilitarian sense) albeit less elegant.

It has a social purpose i.e. communication which applies as much to humans as to other species.  Arguably what makes us unique is how dynamic and complex our communication is relative to other species which merely serves the need to survive. 
In my view the evolution of language cannot be planned or controlled in any real sense despite the efforts of those who would try to do so.  It is like trying to stand on your own shadow, you can never quite do it.
While Nick is criticised for teaching us the bleeding obvious, the point he makes is quite profound.  This knowledge may not lead to a better world or to better life outcomes but it is not the holy grail.  In fact quite the opposite.  It challenges that there is a holy grail, intrinsic truth or fixed reality.  We take our cues from others and our own past experience in understanding our world and lives.  As Alex observes we may in the end fall off a cliff but as a society we organically create counterpoints to offset imbalances as exemplified by the effect of speculators in the market place and so on.

I think ""flatness"" is not the question of brain utilisation. Even for irrational, superficial thinking, most relevant parts of the brain are activated when monitored in the lab AFAIK.     It is an urban legend, that we don't use 90 percent of the old grey matter...

But it is true in that   we  are  -not-  taught    the most important thing in school - critical, even logical thinking. 
Or indeed science, as the most important   -method-     of getting to know/approximate (as best, as possible, with the available update information) our physical and even social reality.

How can we define a democracy at all without the above? Why are we expecting rational choices when people  are manipulated and lied to more or less from birth?
Why do we expect different, when we live in a chaotic unequal society with the economy, including the mass media, and education in the hand of the 0.1% determined to keep the system as it is, ruining the planet and making millions miserable victims of wars, poverty and ignorance while making even more money?

My next thought is if we know how random things are - where do we go from here - it's probably why some people go into politics , trying to change the inevitable, making rules after the problem has already started to go away. Sorry I don't have a solution - I'm only a small cog in the juggernaut.

I am not sure where I stand on mind flatness. One the one hand I feel we are greatly influenced by people, society, culture etc. and I wholeheartedly agree we can be very inconsistent in decision making and opinions, but I struggled to fit  all that with the idea that our past experience can and does shape who we are and how we behave. We surely can all state events , interactions or experiences in our childhood which make us behave in certain ways Yes some are cultural but some are very individual too. So I'm not totally convinced we have flat minds, but I do think they are a lot flatter and shallower than we would like to think.

This would be so simply on extending to others what we would want for ourselves.  
Ironically, to defend liberty (our way of life) we build enormous arsenals of weapons that may destroy the world many times over.  Hence, to defend a way of life we find it rational to destroy life itself.  
This reality is not imposed on us as we have the opportunity to rid ourselves of these weapons through the ballot box. 
Despite the senseless waste of life caused by war throughout history, on a macro level war often brings enormous social change which may be beneficial to society.  However, social change through war cannot be rational so that end can never be used to justify war.  We go to war because we see the past riddled by war and compare what we think we have against what we think we will lose.

all pursuing their own objectives but inevitably we have to interact - 'we thinking' helps us to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes. 
Thinking of the metaphor of two individuals passing each other say on a shopping street both individuals are aware of the outcome if neither step and therefore wish to achieve the mutual benefit of not colliding whilst continuing walking. One individual may have an objective of an uninterupted view of the shop windows and step towards the windows whilst the other individual may have a totally unrelated objective and step the other way (or not).

For me, the best way of explaining the flat mind, of which I am a firm believer, is like sitting at the table and deciding “Hmmm” some jam on the toast would be nice, getting up and going to the refrigerator, then starring into the body of the chest with no thought of why I am there. Having then to go back to sitting at the table and starting to establish what point I was up to, “Oh yes jam!” Getting up again but this time firmly holding onto the jam thought until it was in my grubby little mitt, so I wouldn’t forget it on round two.

Of course we have. It may be tragically imperfect but we are aware of a natural world which isn’t part of society and we are aware of its laws. We are aware of social externals.

Similarly we are aware of the strangely imperishable nature of moral maxims such as “do unto others” and why a moral life leads to a more just society. In an important sense we know this from outside our own society because the logic of it is not limited to the here and now.

As for the good society I think we already have an approximation to it, but because of what we are, we can’t take real advantage of it, can’t accept it anyway and the treadmill has to keep on turning.

As the course has pointed out it is very difficult, maybe impossible, to be objective regarding right and wrong as we are too connected to and influenced by our own society. This must be in part what a flat mind is about. However by questioning and researching deeper one will hopefully begin to be more objective. The outcome may be the same but with better understanding.

With this in mind it would be interesting to understand the history to the formation of human rights and crimes against humanity as well as the reason why some nations do not adhere to these principles.

I will add. having tried to understand the meaning of right and wrong for the last few years and tried to discuss it with many people, you will rarely meet anyone that shares this view or will even take time to discuss it.. So this course is a little step in in furthering this understanding.

(1)  Greg was talking about ways to help Barclays clients to avoid losing money unnecessarily, not using behavioural science ideas to get them to invest more money.

(2)  He wasn't blaming small investors for causing the financial crisis.  He was saying that it's sensible to accept that there will be unpredictable fluctuations in markets and adopt an investment strategy that lets you ride out those fluctuations with minimal emotional stress and financial loss.

(3)  He wasn't suggesting that it's possible to know when the market has bottomed out.  He was pointing out that selling shares at a loss to escape from uncertainty and emotional stress during a market crisis is expensive, and that there are cheaper ways of avoiding emotional discomfort.

(4)  Investment is not just for people ""who have extra money they don't need for a decent standard of life"".  It's also for people making sacrifices in the short term to put aside money for their old age.  If you've only got a small pot of savings then investing it well --- and avoiding making expensive mistakes --- becomes much more important.",2016-12-19 23:07:12 UTC,0,,,,

Essentially we are in agreement.  All I am saying is that even with all the will in the world sticking to investment decisions is very difficult when the trade starts to go against you; hence the abundance of literature about the psychology of investing.

However ........ I believe that, for the reasons Greg talked about in the interview, it's very beneficial to have a degree of attachment when you're making investment decisions.  This is because the results of these decisions play out over longer timescales than we're good at dealing with, and we're prone to making unhelpful interventions (e.g. over-trading) as a result of short-term emotional responses.  Warren Buffett is someone who I believe has a degree of that detachment and who has been a successful investor.  There may or may not be a causal link.

I have also observed that people who focus on their families --- including their descendants --- are better at taking a long term view.  Family-owned private companies in Germany do this, and I believe it has contributed to their success.  And quite a lot of farmers are good at taking the long term view.

(1)  I wasn't disagreeing with your view of banks.  They lost their way very badly a few decades ago, when they underwent a culture change from being respected advisers to profit-seeking companies.  (I could go on for quite a while about the reasons for this change and the negative consequences it has had.)  However, this course isn't about the morals of banks, and we should judge Greg's interview by what he actually says rather than our view of the organisation he works for.

(2)  I don't think anyone was blaming anyone in the interview.  In fact Greg did a good job of defending investors who do something that I, for one, have always regarded as irrational and, in fact, downright stupid --- i.e. sell just after prices have plummeted.  I'd never thought about such behaviour as being a way of ""buying emotional comfort"".

(3)  As Greg pointed out, choosing not to invest your money is an expensive way of buying peace of mind.  Missing out on returns of 4% - 5% per year can really restrict your financial options in later life, particularly if you don't have a lot of spare money in the first place.  ..... continued below",2016-12-20 11:02:28 UTC,0,,,,

I agree that happiness is something that people should create for themselves.

However:-

(1)  Governments need to have some kind of objectives to frame the assessment of policy proposals.  If the objective isn't going to be the happiness of the country's citizens then what should it be?  At the moment it's largely based on economic activity (e.g. GDP growth) ....... but I think we'd all agree that economic activity doesn't necessarily enhance people's quality of life.  The ability to enjoy walking in the countryside or a beautiful city park isn't included in GDP.

(2)  Aren't things like security, education and healthcare pretty much aimed at making people happier?  People are happier if they feel safe, and are very definitely happier if they're in good health.

(3)  Inability to give a quantitative measure of something doesn't mean that you can't have it as an objective.  For example, the fact that I can't ""measure"" my wife's happiness doesn't prevent me from wanting to make my wife happy ..... and having a pretty good idea of how happy she is.  So why can't the Government want to make its citizens happy?  And take common-sense steps to work towards that objective?

(4)  What should a Government do when people, for whatever reason, are choosing to do things that will end up making them unhappier?  Examples might include taking addictive drugs, smoking, putting on weight by eating too much of the wrong kind of food, etc., etc..  People are often not good at anticipating the consequences of their choices, and are also not good at enduring a small amount of discomfort now to avoid a large amount of pain later.

When we see a family member making this kind of mistake we often --- motivated by love and wanting them to be happy --- try to intervene.  Shouldn't the Government also be prepared to intervene when citizens are making this kind of mistake?
I do, of course, realise that this raises questions about how far the Government should go with such interventions and the need to balance people's well-being with their right to make their own decisions (and mistakes).  It's definitely not straightforward, but Governments --- and parents, husbands, wives and friends --- can't dodge the decision --- even refusing to make a decision is, in itself, a decision.",2016-12-20 14:48:57 UTC,4,,,,

The SU managed to survive without them - it was the lack of democracy that rotted the system away from start - and that lack of democracy was not an innate character - it was due to the historical conditions of the time - Russia et al being illiterate, semi-feudal countries mostly without communications and after devastating wars, where the idea of socialism arrived too soon and messed up its global development catastrophically.

In dog behaviour theory, a dog can be stimulated (e.g. by a dominant dog elsewhere) and can attack the nearest person/dog/object - it's called displaced aggression - in my example, the trigger is a different dog , but as a target is close, that target is attacked. It is generally perceived by the receiver that the dog is aggressive whereas in fact is it a response to fear (flight/fight) to the bully nearby, frustration vent. http://animalhealings.com/articles/displaced-aggression.html

When I am emotionally stimulated that I am more likely to demonstrate an exaggerated response to something else through frustration, not because my brain is telling me that the cause is something else - it's a displaced response. I know when I do this - purely as something this behaviour is important to me to keep under control and I am actively aware the cause is something else, so still feel the response. In the experiment, it's misplaced outlet for the adrenaline, which the participants in the experiment had no control. People may not be aware of their frustrations/stimulations elsewhere.

We have to make decisions if we want to act - and humans supposed to be active participants in controlling their future. If new information contradicts us, then we have to change those opinions and action based on them, accordingly.

The question, ""Can you tell a masterpiece from a monstrosity?"" seemed to suggest the former, but there were also references to ""whether we like something or not"".

And, finally, the course title ""The Mind is Flat"" is misleading and very unhelpful.

Our minds do have some very interesting and non-intuitive ways of working, but ""flat"" is definitely not the right word to describe them.

It's clear from the comments that many --- or even most --- of the course participants have not understood what Nick means by a ""flat mind"".  (I tried to clarify that in a comment in section 6.3.  Click on ""most liked"" and look for my reply to Sue McLachlan's comment.)

Social engineering has as many flaws as it has benefits.  The socialist utopia that Eva presents as the antidote to endemic unhappiness is exactly that 'utopian'.  Stalin's implementation of state owned farms in the Soviet Union was rejected by the peasantry as much as by the aristocracy who owned the land.  The peasants had only recently acquired their freedom and up to 6 million died trying to hold onto it.
There is of course a place for experts but not all aspects of social life can or should be planned and organized by what becomes a meritocracy.  What is becoming more and more apparent with things like the Brexit vote and the willingness of electorates to vote for anything anti-establishment is that a substantial proportion of the electorate dislikes being told what is best for them.  A nudge here and a nudge there may be tolerated for a time but history has shown time and time again that populations rebel when they have had enough.

I looked at how we were spending money, analysed how we were being persuaded to part with our money and learned to simplify our lives. I looked at how we were often doing things we didn't really feel comfortable doing but would do anyway because that was what was expected of us as a family. Good friends stuck around, others melted away. I realise now, that I am much more contented with my life, we have cleared huge amounts of debt which we will never run up again, and I have learned to try not to be swayed by many of the external influences which used to, often unknowingly, sway me before.

I then told him that it is because they do not have internet and computer as much as we do. He then asked ""then how are they suppose to be happy?""

I think to rate happiness is technically impossible because it will then come down to the question of do we have what we want to have. And people who are expose to things that they will never get will always list those things as ""things that I want in life"" therefore makes them unhappy which in actual fact that it doesnt have a causal relationship. The notion of ""used to the happy things already long ago in life and now not making me happy anymore"" do also come into play in this situation.

Happiness rating in this case is really not an accurate scale of our inward feelings, we tend of look outward to seek for the ""comparatively better/worse"" so that we can fare and dictate that yes we are happier or no we are not.

A ""good society"" is an abstraction conjuring up notions of freedom, equality and safety for all but devoid of any historical context.  
Perhaps the better question is what is a tolerable society but this is also relative.  The rich and powerful often don't see themselves as such and compare themselves with those who have more wealth and/or power rather than the poor. 
Ironically, to obtain an idea of a good society we need to transcend the flat mind and determine some qualitative basis to the concept and an objective basis for measurement.  Ostensibly, this is a job for experts but it is unlikely the populace would gladly cede their idea of a good society without resistance.  In the end the issue is political engendering dispute and conflict and ultimately war.

First of all, a dollar 200 years ago was a completely different animal than it is today. Clear text: the 85% have been reduced in real terms to somewhere between 55 and 75%.

Secondly, giving people a tin roof doesn't raise their quality of life, it just puts them in extremely hot housing, favella style. Plus I fail to see the advantage of energy supplied through a central, extremely expensive grid, if it could be produced much more efficiently locally.

Thirdly, measuring life quality by assigning a monetary value leads consistently to wrong results.

There are several more points I could make, but let me just offer this last thought. If you want to give all the people in the world who earn one dollar a day a second dollar a day, it wouldn't even make a perceptible dent in the ""defense"" budget of the US, while at the same time the middle class is rapidly moving towards poverty, and infant mortality in the US is on the rise.

As for tin roofs - not much of a ""choice"" if that is all you can afford.

Do remember, freedom of choice in our liberal capitalism (turning self-boastingly illiberal now in several places of the EU) means free choice * if and only if * you have enough money/power to buy it. 

Yes, people want to control their own life, not only the pretence that they do, though unfortunately, being gullible means that they are easy to fool into thinking that they are in control, when far from it.

There's always a better choice than the uninsulated, corrugated metal roofs that one sees so often in developing countries. There are a wide range of grasses or leaves for instance, or clay tiles that are easy to manufacture locally by the builders themselves. But business can't make as much money as if they sell metal roofs.

In the name of economic advance, people have since 100 years been persuaded to trade quality for fashionable foolishness. This extends to the rest of the building as well. Especially in earthquake prone places, buildings made from bamboo (a rapidly replenishing resource btw that's stronger than steel by weight) are a far superior choice both cost wise and for standing up during a quake. Durability has been extended from an average seven to more than 30 years.

Thank you for your comments and the time you invested in them. I want to note, that economic activity doesn't necessarily enhance people's quality of life AFTER some level, but providing this level of welfare should be an aim of the government, I think. If you struggle to find food or shelter or medical care when you need it, you wont be that happy.

Things like security, education and healthcare in my view are aimed more on keeping the society as a whole stable and productive. Not everybody was ""happy"" about things like vaccination when they started and even now, but they sure save millions of lives.

I dont think that any government will ever have relationships with its citizens as close, as you have with your wife and family. At least I hope this will never happen to my family and government. Government is a system, not a person, so it should treat everyone fairly and equally, without any emotions. 

People are often not good at anticipating the consequences of their choices - I agree, so I wouldn't choose to give the decision power over my life to some people in the government, just because they work in the government. My life = my mistakes = my responsibility.",2016-12-24 18:28:46 UTC,0,,,,

The point that particularly stood out for me was that humans develop their language and communication skills in different ways, which we perceive as cultural differences, learning actions from their parents whereas animal's behaviour is consistant.  I mentioned previously, in dogs if they do not have the correct socialisation when young, they are not able to ""read"" or ""understand"" other dog's signals properly creating behavioral problems which means dogs learn aswell and it's not just biological as suggested here. It could be that dog's behaviour has not evolved and perhaps, if humans behaviour had not evolved, we too would just have common underlying basic behaviors that are just the same, though, of course we do not know that.

It has been fascinating to both read the articles and to also have watched the videos you've put together. I found it enlightening, and feel I have been able to both uncover and tap into the deeper parts of my thought process. I have also been able to consolidate and to relate to some of the suspicions I have had in the past around 'cooking up responses', we are being 'fictional characters in stories of our own invention', and our brain being an 'improviser' often driven by our personal values, experiences and personality. 


I also can relate to the fact, some of us would often rationalise choices we make, and when we reflect on decisions we've made in the past, instead of learning from our shortfalls we concentrate on rationalise our choices where we know the end result. 


I also appreciate that, though we think we live in society where we are free to choose as we please, but the truth can anything but, and often very unsettling. ",2016-12-28 18:18:50 UTC,0,,,,

I once read a quote somewhere, and it read happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are all in harmony. I think there is some truth to this, and if there was a list we could maintain for each person of things they want, and then cross off the ones they've achieved at any given point in time, we could then use this to measure 'happiness'. 

Relative nature of happiness is an issue as often what we think we want could change with time. Perhaps we need to factor this in, come up with a model to consider 'indecisive' nature of our mind. ",2016-12-29 10:35:09 UTC,0,,,,

Ten years later you could find the occasional private milk cow, but not one farm producing milk for commercial gain. It was cheaper to throw the milk away than to bring it to market.

In developing countries there is a bit more leeway, but you find crazy laws, like in parts of Mexico, with sunshine out the ears, where in response to my question why they didn't use solar, that it was forbidden, and that they were required to buy electricity from the central energy provider.

However,  6 weeks is a short time frame for an educational programme and I suppose I did not expect to come away from the course with much more than a little more knowledge about psychology.

As I said before, the materials could have been better presented, perhaps with an overview at the beginning, but I nevertheless found the material stimulating and thought provoking and well worth the effort.

It seems to me that some precision in the definition of happiness is needed. One suggestion might be anything that makes an individual feel good but at nobody else's expense. One thing that seems high on the feel good factor might be a sense of being part of a community. Time and time again we hear of this in flooding of towns where people pull together and get to know each other over a common cause. There are lots of examples of "" community spirit"". It seems we need to belong and have a definite social role.. this appears to be the case in other animal species that have a social organisation.

The concept of happiness seems to unwieldy, fluctuating and subjective to be meaniful or indeed to be measurable. Richness of society or an individual s wealth don't really equate with each other meanifully. In order to measure something you need something to be measurable.

Could be we are looking for happiness in the wrong places and happiness comes as a by-product of certain activities e.g.: a sense of community, a meaning to your life, gratitude for what you have. ",2017-01-02 10:54:32 UTC,1,,,,

So, willingness to buy items that are regarded as high class may be desired by people that can easily afford it. For middle class and poor class the decision making process is lot more complicated. When it comes to products such as luxury holidays, people's buying power will have a role to play as much as ones desire to lavishly spend money to both enjoy the power of their wealth and the break they so deserve in their mind. Travel agents will therefore package holidays in different bundles with different classes in mind. Although the success of their effort will be mixed but irrespective of which classes the products are aimed at, I suspect, agents will exploit fair amount of manipulation in order to give people a little bit of what consumers think they want, and lot more of what agents want to sell.

Beauty idols and pop icons dictate what is the ideal image we should obtain, in order to be worthy of love and respect. Wealth is our pinnacle of happiness, and not by choice or by any inherent value. Simply survivalism.
True narcissistic personalities are relatively rare. Yet, it does seem like everyone is a narcissist nowadays, doesn't it? That is actually a coping mechanism. Technology opened a window to the world, and along with it, gone is the sense of individual worth.
