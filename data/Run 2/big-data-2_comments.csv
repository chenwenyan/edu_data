I want to further delve into the two hypotheses drawn. 

GDP per capita of the countries that have a future orientation index of more than 1 is said to be more than those that have an index of less than 1. And internet infrastructure is likely to be more where GDP is more. 

However, it is hard to assimilate that users interested in the year before should necessarily belong to countries with a lower GDP, as they still are browsing and IT infrastructure is likely to be equally established as in those countries where searches are for the future year. So I think while a hypothesis may be drawn about the GDP per capita from FO Index, however the hypothesis that IT infrastructure is better where users are more future oriented seems a bit biased. Browsing for the past year or future year does not necessarily tell us that infrastructure of IT in a country is poor if FO index is less than 1 and so on. Though it tells us that regardless which year is being searched for infrastructure is present in any case in the first place. Any comments?

I would like to know how to cut through the jargon and buzz words in the market research arena (such as that awful term ""Big Data"" - a term that would have Orwell, Shakespeare and Donne spinning in their graves). Having worked with retail index and consumer / household panel data since the 1980s, transaction log data since the 1990s and more recently shopper card information I am wondering just how much has really changed and how much is marketing / consulting smoke and mirrors. Thus I am taking this program to understand - from an independent academic institution - what is really going on that is that much different to before.

""Big Data,"" a term down there with phrases used by waiters in chain public houses, those who declaim ""I'm good"" when you ask them how they are, and those who apologise with ""My bad"" when they have run out of the garlic mushrooms.

Whatever next. The motor industry launching ""Nice cars?""

Therefore, I am not yet getting that excited that Brits look to the future and are rich and that Canadians look to the past and are not so rich. 

And can the nationally averaged GDP data set and the internet search data set be matched? Canadian rich people might all be out spending their wealth and huntin and fishin and with no need to play about on google. And in India the poor may not have access to Google.

Update: BTW the search criteria has also been refined since I first plugged this in as a search for the most usual UK abbreviation 'GP' 18 months ago.

Without repeating what has already been said I am personally (or my home is)  creating a lot of data. I have connected lighting with schedules for turning lights in various rooms on and off. I have a connected home monitoring device that keeps track of noise levels, temperature, humidity and air quality. It 'knows' if the house is occupied, if a window is smashed or if an alarm sounds and will alert me wherever I am. These both connect with IFTTT so I have recipes set up there too. Let's hope they don't get hacked! I'll hopefully have a connected thermostat sometime this year. I have streaming boxes so lots of data there on my watching and listening habits. I wear a fitness band and use GPS based running apps that track where I run and when. I'm currently using a food logging app too. I have a connected CCTV system and a dash cam in my car with wifi.

Then there are the various supermarket loyalty cards in my wallet. Lots of valuable data there about what I buy and where and when.

There are countless internet accounts for shopping, social media and lots more besides all of which can be used to build a profile of 'me'. And don't even get me started on my mobile!",2016-03-07 14:26:28 UTC,,6

Our GDP is globally quite high, we have a large number of Internet users, we fit in almost every way with the countries that search for the future instead of the past - except we aren't one of those countries.

I don't have a hypothesis for this, and would prefer to see data over a longer time period to see if the correlation continues (and of course both hypotheses ignore the idea that a third factor comes into play, and that both these correlated data points are in fact a result of that third factor).",2016-03-07 14:29:10 UTC,,17

Not sure whether the data set can be used to actually prove or disprove the hypotheses though, because - as Suzy and Tobias say themselves in the very first video - big data is different from 'traditional' data in that it is pretty restricted in what it gives, so you can't drill down to get more details.  This is potentially problematic because an untestable hypothesis is not much use to anyone.  It would be interesting to add in data from other search engines used frequently in non-Western countries, and to include Islamic calendar years (current year is 1437, I believe) to get a broader picture.

No attendance records are kept for MPs. Other than the geolocation data the only way of knowing if they were working is mention in Hansard and that only notes those who spoke or were bused in to pass through the voting lobbies as lobby fodder.

By selecting countries based upon (total population => 5million) perhaps this may have blurred some of the findings.
I understand that in some countries with small total populations (such as NZ), Google is unable to provide data because search activity is too low, but what if the initial country selections had been based not just on the minimum total population of 5 million, but also by % of internet users per capita within those countries?
So, simple data segmentation could have been created around perhaps, each countries internet usage (in percentage quartiles), perhaps then the data analysis may have revealed much more in terms of any correlation between 'economic performance, infrastructure & internet usage'.

I do not know what it is trying to capture other than people ""searching"" for information.  Just because many people are clicking away at websites does not mean they are necessarily searching for information.  Some people just wander across internet sites aimlessly going from one site to another as and when interesting prompts are seen.

It is true that large amount of data can be gathered by the internet.  But there is also large amount of useless data out there.  

My behaviour at my computer cannot be fully grasped by someone miles away looking at what I'm doing at my computer.  For example, no one knows whether I'm writing this straight from my head to the computer or whether I wrote it first on a piece of paper and then typing it at the keyboard or dictating it to someone to type it in for me.

If I go to 20 different sites at one sitting, does it mean I've done 20 lots of searches?  It is misleading to look at remote digital information and draw valid conclusion.

Yes, Russia is good example. But if they have so many options to search (incl. local engines), it means the infrastructure is good. 1/3 from total searches from Russia gives higher number of searches comparing with some countries with higher index ratio (Switzerland and some others). And I think we cannot tell that Google users are typically looking more into past events.

Also, if they have some restrictions or tracks, or are not satisfied with their State bodies, it would probably mean they tend to look if they have elections or other events coming next year which could change their life and such regulations. (What would have given higher ratio.)

I think it would be useful to compare searches around, for example, a particular health issue (cancer?) on the various search engines to get an idea of the relative frequency - as a proportion of total searches - at each search engine.  So for Google it might be 3% of searches and Bing might be 2% and Baidu might be 5%.  This could then be used to give an indication of the relative importance attached to the issue by users of each search engine.  Repeating this exercise across several topics (eg money, education, international conflicts) would help build up a picture of topics that are the same across all search engines and geographic areas, and those that differ.   Then, if a researcher only has access to Google data for eg searches-on-heart-attacks, and shows that those searches are very rare using Google in China, they can refer back to the findings on cancer I mentioned above and use that as an indication as to how likely heart-attack-searches are using other search engines in China.

Firstly, that the potential of big data for providing insights into trends we wouldn't previously have been able to identify is both huge and now relatively simple to access and analyse. 

Secondly, data without context is incredibly difficult to interpret. This study suggests two key hypotheses, but there could be a whole load more that the data could presumably be used to support. What's the phrase - lies, damned lies and statistics...? Without context, stats can be used to support almost any argument, so with the volume of statistics that could be generated from big data understanding the context becomes even more important if we aren't to misinterpret findings.

A traditional desktop its generally possible to upgrade a graphics card and it needn't cost more than £30 to £40. With laptops its essential to ensure the hardware meets required specifications.

People who search using the cultural scheme you mentioned are likely to search time related topics, both past or present, with the same metric.

Furthermore, if we look at ratio between people who search future years relative to past years, your concern may be unfounded.

This is exciting and I am pretty sure there is a huge amount of value to be extracted from these seas, in all domains (energy, health, crime, etc.). Yet, as with any powerful tool, it is not necessarily the tool in itself which is useful or harmful but the way it is used. Big data has to be developed with a clear conscience of its possibilities and possible flaws. Not all correlations mean something. Is the data pool relevant? Is the interpretation of the data correct? Is past behavior always representative of future behavior? Predicting the future thanks to the past is highlighting trends and extrapolating them further, which can be useful, but then what about disruption ? And what about ethics in all this? Do we want for example to live in a world where insurance premiums could be adjusted thanks to IoT captors and big data, calculating your probability to get sick or die? How do we use this potential without ending up in Minority Report or 1984? I am not criticizing or against Big Data (which is already there anyway), just highlighting the need to be careful with it.

I definitely think in my part of the world our government is performing social engineering and it's pretty annoying too. I think George Orwell under projected government intrusiveness in his book ""1984"". I've been watching Top Gear re-runs over here in the US. I love the irreverence of it all. 
We used to have ""Cannon Ball"" runs coast to coast. That was irreverent as well. As part of middle class society we should revisit our individualism and reassert ourselves.

For example managing people with big data, could mean ending or quashing legitimate protests and civil disobedience. Human beings are extremely susceptible to behavioural patterns, and big data could be used to increasingly manipulate people. People could end up being more and more managed and cattled by societies and businesses. The more ignorant about such behavioural patterns and manipulations the less resistant to such manipulations humans are. 

I think there is serious cause for concern about behavioural economics using big data as a means of negating freedom to the extend to making us more and more passive and consumptive beings. Unregulated consumption capitalist practices are a serious problem because of the environmental/ecological impact. 

I personally think informed consent is a far better way to assist people in making a good decision than using 'nudge' methods. Educate the population sufficiently and they make better decisions, empower the people and they will change the socio-political landscape for the betterment of themselves and the environment. Nudging should be the final resort not the first port of call. ",2016-03-08 16:23:18 UTC,,15

I suppose it is possible but it is quite a cynical way of looking at it. And I tend to think now that it's much more likely that governments are a mix of being lazy, complacent, and under funded. I however can't help but remind myself of high levels of military spending, nor the fact that poverty has a primary causal relationship with crime, wellbeing and health indicators. And I cannot help but think that greater socio-economic distribution of wealth across a wider demographic would reduce many of these problems. Thus resulting in a population in the long term, more open to accademic narratives and therefore more likely to think more carefully about education and ethical aspects of how they inhabit and interact with the social sphere around them. A more engaged overall population is a more stable and respectful population and one more likely to be respond better to information. Thus the impact of informing for directing outcomes in a population would be higher.

It wouldn't be functional as a big data set alone (which was your point, I believe), but it would certainly be valuable to be included in one. It raises the question, that will undoubtedly come up, with what data can be added to larger sets and what anonymization is required to protect the levels of privacy we expect. 

There is also a theoretical question, that possibly won't be covered here, as to whether we are able to predict, with such a certain degree of accuracy, someone's behaviour that it could constitute an invasion of privacy? I guess this is more the domain of political theorists and policy writers.

Confirmation bias, in the sense that a business school is based on the principle that wealth (and as a result, GDP) can be created through intelligent activities, and the availability heuristic in the sense that academics are familiar with people searching for information and forecasts relating to future years.

Without more information on what people are using the internet for in certain places, it's very difficult to even come up with any hypothesis. From what little I know, a lot of future based activity on the internet is booking (where I would also fall foul of the availability heuristic, but I'm not making any strong assertion, merely a counterpoint). Countries with a higher GDP per capita have a strong correlation with higher levels of disposable income, meaning that you are more able and likely to search for flight prices, concerts, and other upcoming events. The data represented in the paper would also support this, though I wouldn't feel strongly enough, to make any claim, but it would be a useful hypothesis to direct the next level of interrogation.

I agree that it's what the data is used for, but it's very difficult to extrapolate enough information to understand either A) whether a search for a political party suggests support for that party, or B) how to narrow down an issue to a common search term and what a persons viewpoint on that issue might be.

Take example B. I'm pretty sure that ""EU referendum"" is a trending search entry, both inside and outside the UK, but it doesn't tell us what someone thinks about it. If they were to search ""EU referendum out arguments/reasons"", we might assume that there is a large degree of confirmation bias of people wanting UK to leave the EU, but similarly, it could be someone trying to understand the arguments on the other side of the equation, who has every intention of voting to stay in.

Where this is in the private and public realm it serves a different purpose, though neither are necessarily benign/noble in nature, even if they could be in application.

Academics: Allows for better understanding of behavioural trends. Findings could be applied in 'better serving' needs identified, which in turn can lead to promoting and replicating/perpetuating patterns of behaviour that may be either counter-productive or otherwise transient.

Specifically thinking of Auckland, where I am living, the public transport is poorly utilised (and largely honesty based), over 95% of peak hour traffic is single occupancy, high density housing is being developed spread across the city, and billions of dollars are being spent on new motorways (in a city of around 1.5 million people).

The opportunity is to mine the cellular data, property sales and council databases of building permits to:
- see peoples traffic patterns, match to others with similar patterns, and tune public transport and reduce the number of single occupant cars.
- see areas of high growth and ensure public transport (and if necessary new roadways) are put in place.  In some cases, early warning of an area becoming more important may help in securing the needed land for motorways much earlier (therefore reducing the cost).

The side of effects of more public transport, and more efficient use the private vehicle fleet is reduced need to continually build roads (a major saving) and less pollution (helping reach emission targets - saving both penalties and long term health costs).

It may or may not be a hypothesis that can be satisfactorily resolved with big data alone (my suspicions, which I'm here to examine, are that it is unlikely to), but it's certainly not a bad starting point, and it may well be prudent practice to exhaust the avenue of big data, before going down to more detail outside (which may be more invasive, and so require a greater degree consent from a sample group). 

I think that, with supporting studies, multiple big data enquiries could yield some conclusions (e.g. if we could deduced that 70% of incidences of a political party being entered into a search engine were positive, the search rate would be give a good indication of support). The problem is that things of this nature (especially politics) are so mutable, and context specific, it presents a risk of applying a rule ad infinitum, and actually deriving conclusions that are wholly misrepresentative.

David, completely agree with what you are saying, and that was my point (which I think you got).

There are always supplementary methods of turning ""bad data"" into ""good data"", but there are also instances that the level of supporting evidence required, overcomes the initial economies of scale we may assume from taking a big data approach. It's still an obvious and good starting point to get to the conclusions that you feel it already provides Rakesh. 

An example, currently in the news, might be people searching ""Hilary Clinton Honduras"", or ""Hilary Clinton emails"", which shouldn't be assumed as political support for Hilary Clinton.

*Food matching
*What did I buy around the same time? cooking ingredients? a takeaway meal?

But I believe that the more nuanced a humans framework of reference and understanding about the world is, in particular the ethical realm, the more likely they are to make better decisions. In respect of ethics most people have a fairly shallow interpretation and understanding of the field. I don't think this helps people make good decisions.

I don't deny people will always make bad decision. But I don't believe ignorance is an asset in better decision making. 

I think asking how rational humans ever are is a very reasonable question. However I suspect it is difficult to universalise a pattern of rationality in respect of the human condition. I think it is far more likely rationality can only be measured on an individual level. In that respect the more exposed a human is to complex argument, and the more they are exposed to a high level of education the more likely they are to make decisions that acknowledge the complexity and nuanced nature of reality.

1. In some instances, people might not be googling previous years exclusively out of a lack of financial forecast but for sourcing previous academic journals or recent historical events which appeared in the news and are archived on the net, perhaps all done in reference to current research and news.
2. The future orientation index may definitely be a good way to establish whether people look to the future and planning ahead (this generally includes financial planning). So,well done on using this method.
3. Excluding countries with less than 5 million users may limit the results in the context of studying 'Global' internet use. I say this because we may be overlooking something important, growth in internet usage and therefore information gain. According to the World Internet Users Statistics (Nov 2015) Africa as a continent, which is totally excluded (with 330,965,359 users) has increased internet usage by 7,23%. I however understand as said in the paper that Google Trends does not provide information on some of these areas. This may be a limitation.

However, what I also find interesting is when data produced for one specific reason is found to provide value in ways never initially envisaged.
One example is the company Jawbone. They develop and market a fitness tracker wristband product. This does all the usual 'fitness tracker things' as well as track people's sleep patterns etc. This data is all uploaded to a cloud server and displayed back to the user as personal information.
And this is where that 'anonymised', bulk data was found to be extremely useful back in late August 2014 in California. An earthquake (apparently the biggest for 25 years) struck at 3.20am.
- Almost 80% of users within 25 miles of the earthquake woke up at 3.20am.
- As did 60% of users within 50 miles of the earthquake.
- And 20% of users within 100 miles of the epicenter. 
Jawbone released a graph of that morning showing how people's sleep patterns were disturbed, and the information provided useful additional insights for seismologists.

I agree that the human eye is powerful in recognising patterns (and outliers) when data is displayed visually. 

I also understand that visual representation of data allows it to be more accessible to more people who are not statisticians. It can also mean faster discoveries and more time for the scientists/analysts to be working on the discoveries and their applications as opposed to time spent on crunching the numbers. 

From a personal point of view, I am fascinated by how data can be presented visually. It is a new art form. 

Kind Regards

my problem is that there can be so many factors that I am not sure if that correlation is meaningful. what if the real cause is the popularity of some TV show that ended last year? or if people google for the olympics that were in 2010 and not in 2012? (this is an example, I am too lazy to google the years of olympics). what if there's a band called 'red hot chili 2010' that sings in Spanish?
what if in China they predominantly use other search engine?

Being Italian, I automatically associate the term ""world cup"" with the FIFA world cup and the initial result utterly confirmed my association: big spikes appear in coincidence with jun/jul 2006, 2010, 2014, i.e the last three editions. But then I went down to look at the regional interest and found Bangladesh, Pakistan and Nepal in the first positions and could not understand why, since to me they do not seem to be ""football-oriented"" countries. Selecting one of them, I had the confirmation that these countries were not so much interested in the FIFA world cup (ok, just a bit), but extremely interest in the cricket world cup. The first diagram changed accordingly.
Out of curiosity, I selected New Zealand, to get the obvious: interest was in the rugby world cup.
What do I make of this? First of all, I started with my pre-conception of ""world cup"" and tried to fit the results to my pre-conception, right or wrong.
Secondly, my country (because of the language) is not represented..
Thirdly, different countries (different people) give entire different meaning to the same words. Very hard job, indeed.",2016-03-13 16:18:09 UTC,,17

2) What is the search - behaviour gap and is it predictable?  Here rain is a good example of a difference between the search activity and the behaviour.

In logistics, we used a forecasting system with various algorithms for different demand patterns.

Back then, a forecasting system didn't 'know' that a religious film was popular at easter, or if a sequel to a particular film had just been released, or an actor was in the news for whatever reason. On the music side, what if a band was on tour or it was the anniversary of an artists death.

So, there was always a human between the forecasting system and the ordering system.

Perhaps this is now done, but I imagine adding in search patterns to the equation could substantially help forecasting in many fields. Of course the issue in the music and video industry is now clouded by streaming services, so you may search for but have no intention of buying a physical product.

Hence since every possible outcome is real, coincidence is in fact just the experience you feel as you don’t know which universe you ended up in.

Having said that side note :) , I think that predictions affecting behavior is about the most important thing to consider if you want to use predictions to gain advantages. And not just the risk of changing behavior in a way you didn’t attend to.

This is a situation that has been going on for over a quarter of century but the LEA shows no intention of doing a jot about it. The figures are available but they don't care.

The problem is that the catchment areas for these schools are small and consist in the main of our large village and not much else.

One could extend that to train services.

Google have been collecting and analysing data on effectiveness of adverts and their positioning on the screen. So the ads on the right hand side of the screen have had it, because people simply learnt to ignore them and fewer and fewer people are clicking on them, let alone buying anything. Also, more people are using mobiles and portrait layout of the screen doesn't lend itself too well to placing adverts on the right (unlike landscape screen layout of laptop etc). The top and bottom of a web page - becomes more valuable place for advert positioning.

My local council provides five different receptacles for household waste: plastics/wood/cardboard/paper, general, garden, food, and compost.The garden waste bin is for those things difficult to compost, such as perennial weeds or wood. The food waste bin is for cooked foods, which should never be put on a conventional compost bin because of attracting vermin. The last one is never emptied by them because it's for households to make their own compost. However, they don't provide ""hot box"" compost boxes; if they did then the two more would be unnecessary namely the garden and food waste because the contents that are put in them could then be composted at home. 

Big data could be used to determine the levels of garden and food waste being put out for collection. Monitoring it would show whether distributing free hot boxes would save money.

Big data could also verify that items are placed in the correct bin. Scanning bar codes on packaging could alert councils to who use the wrong bin.",2016-03-15 09:48:11 UTC,,2

Just as now if you use Google to search something, you are automatically directed to the ""most popular"" or ""most likely"" sites to visit according to the Google algorithm.  This tends to direct most people to the top of the list and end up reading the same sites.  This in turn means those sites have a disproportionate affect on the knowledge base and thinking of the readers such that they all end up thinking in the same way.  ie Google actually REDUCES choice and results in a lack of originality.  This is a very dangerous trend especially since the algorithms are constantly updated and so the more people who read the first choice site they are directed to means the points allocated to this partciular site make it continue to top the list (ie it is self perpetuating).

For example, if I learn that a certain route from destination A to destination B has historically proved to be problematic and, as a consequence, I decide to change my behavior and take an alternative route (one that has, in the past, proven to be much more efficient), won't I and others behaving like me make this new route problematic as a result?

The study on the value-added of search-based box-office predictions of movies, games and music was, I thought, very well done in that regard. They didn't promote their methods and results as the be-all, end-all of methods, but compared them (sometimes unfavorably) to more classic, old-fashioned studies. Their main advantage however is speed, flexibility and low-cost. So if a search-based study gives us comparable results to an old-fashioned study with those advantages, that's progress.

When a system that is NOT anti fragile encounters a black swan it may not be able to deal with the new environment and fail. Essentially because it is unable to adapt.

When a system that IS anti fragile encounters a black swan it may be able to deal with the new environment and survive. Essentially because it is able to adapt.

""There are quite a few people who used data to predict the financial crisis...""
Karl Marx is probably the big one of course ;) 

But - yes and no. There is currently a bubble in London house prices for instance, and many people are 'predicting' a crash sometime in the near future (me, for example). But nobody is committing to a time and date, and in the meantime many people will make big profits by buying in to the bubble.  After its happened of course, we will all be tweeting about our great foresight and how we foresaw the whole thing. 

I'm not sure that too many people predicted the global banking crisis though, and especially it's timing. That's partly because the things that caused the crash - securitisation of mortgages and credit default swaps being the big ones I think - were actually designed to /minimise/ the risk of big losses, by spreading that risk about ('spreading' as in 'muck' in this case).

So I guess you need to fool your subject of observation into thinking you're definitely looking the other way, and definitely not trying to predict their behaviour. Or better yet, fool them into thinking no one is even remotely interested in their behaviour, because as soon as someone feels observed (even if it's a mental condition that gives them the idea of being followed) they change their behaviour.

Then he had his friends who had stayed in laugh at him and boast about how much they were making - so he bought back in at a higher price, and watched it crash, making him bankrupt.

The Saturn V rocket thruster for example was used to launch the Apollo missions - a grand human endeavour - but not long after it was mounted with warheads to become ICBMs.

Big Data I feel is little different, it could be used to free us from burdensome bureaucracy and lagging policy-making or utilised to further secure the positions of those in power: despots, dictators, rogue states etc.. by leveraging its subsequent insights against public knowledge and will.

With great technology comes greater responsibility.

That this has happened at a time when big and real-time data is becoming so widely available is no doubt creating tensions in academic departments.

Obviously there are things like social media privacy settings to control what people can see and you don't have to use the geolocation options to 'check in'.

You can turn off bluetooth and wifi when you are out so your phone is not tracked. You can even stop using things like supermarket loyalty cards if you don't want to give them a lot of data. Then you can read in full all the T&C's for apps you install so you can make informed choices about the data you are giving others access to. Then of course there are passwords and general network security at home.

There are services like data patrol that scan for the use of your various ID numbers online such as passport, credit cards, driving license, and anything else with a number associated.

Ditto for those in financial markets.

It's a very simplistic hypothesis based on a correlation between one reasonably well-defined variable (GDP) and one not so clearly pinned down. Is it always valid that '2009' and '2011' signify past and future oriented searches (for example, many past songs and films have future years in their titles)?

I could not cite such research without immediately questioning the representativeness of the sample. Was Milgram's 'recognisability' a valid measure of some abstract 'visibility', or of real 'social mobility'? I'm sure the researchers thought about this when they did their Oyster card study, which showed that everyone goes to well-off areas, but people from them don't go to deprived areas - at least not on public transport (mightn't they go in taxis, vans or cars?). I feel that at every step of every presentation of every analysis of social big data, we're being asked to make questionable assumptions, or at least to ignore all behaviour that doesn't conform to the hypothetical framework the data is somewhat being forced to fit. In the web game, for example, do we really know from IP addresses what city people are 'from', when the use of VPNs (eg in China) might even be masking the city they're in?

One of the great triumphs of statistics was Sir Stephen Doll linking cigarette smoking and lung (and other) cancers. His work has saved millions from an early and unpleasant death. However it took the best part of 30 years to move from published research to significant cuts in smoking and consequent health benefits. 

In part that was push-backs of various sorts from the tobacco industry and a lot was the inertia in changes to human behaviour that you refer to. But change did come and many lives were, and are being, saved. Behaviour was influenced in part by targeted taxation pushing up the cost of smoking, part was education, part was changes in fashion. 

An alternative success story would be seat-belts in cars, which in the UK are enforced by law.  This was also identified by analysis of data - in this case on road traffic accidents. Again life saving, again requires behavioural change - in this case brought about by direct government action. (Compare and contrast with adherence to speed limits.)",2016-03-17 19:10:27 UTC,,2

On another note: 
It seems to me that there is some sort of data collection mania -- collecting data just for the sake of doing it, because I can, and because everyone is doing it. 
What interests me is whether the data that is being collected is blinded. What about PII (personally identifiable information). It is one thing when people provide data without providing their PII that is used for, e.g., urban planning, but another thing when the smartphone knows my mood or who my contacts are or what messages I wrote. That is really, really invasive. I want my privacy.

A new version of Google glass seems likely, we have head cams, and haptic feedback devices have reached the stage where  gloves provide sensitive enough pressure inputs to hands to be used to train surgeons and pressure sensing allows us to control robot hands. Put this lot together and we could, for instance, share the experience of someone on holiday by seeing what they see, feeling the ambient temperature and their movements as they ski, ride, sail or simply sit in the sun looking at the view. Not only can we talk to /them/ - we could join in conversations they are having with other people.

If you or I were incapable of consistently being logical then we would not be able to construct coherent sentences, add 1+1, or even formulate a theory about psychological bias. Overall we are relatively rational beings. 

Human beings in normative circumstances make decisions within their knowledge scope, within that scope their decision making will be to some greater or lesser degree consist of both logical and biased decisions. 

You seem to be exhibiting comfirmation bias in favour of bias as an overarching model of the human condition, your readings and learning has no doubt reinforced this model. This does not prove your argument, it simply reinforces the view that humans tend towards constructing narratives, where sometimes parts of those narratives are extremely rational, other times they are not.

It is possible, for example, to monitor automatically (no human intervention) someone's vital signs (e.g. blood glucose levels, heart rate, blood pressure, whether they're moving around the house and even their gait). It will therefore be possible to create so-called smart houses which, equipped with the right tech and the right algorithms, could identify if and when residents need help or medical intervention.

The main limitation seems to be that there has to be a link between what people SEARCH for and what they actually end up DOING.  This doesn’t mean that everyone searching needs to end up doing something as a result, just that enough of them do so  for an observable pattern to emerge.

Then repeat this with a different claim (‘Bendy bananas allowed’) and compare the spikes to see which has attracted greater interest – and update campaign strategy accordingly.  The trending data from twitter could also be incorporated to add another perspective.

Of course if I’ve just come up with this idea, it means that both sides will probably have thought of it long ago and are even now busily doing something similar.  And, like an arms race, as each side works out how to ‘poach’ voters from the other, they’ll then work out how to undermine the opposition’s poaching tactics, so this will go on and on….

Then, at a university lecture, this could be live-streamed to a display so the lecturer can see when the audience is getting bored or confused, or when they’re following OK.  Not just at lectures – think of all those business meetings that turn unproductive because attendees have switched off or lost the plot.  The improvements in learning/productivity, and the increased ‘honesty’ levels, would be of great benefit both individually and to the economy.  

Then there are other areas – live TV broadcasts, parliamentary speeches, traffic signs (do drivers understand them?)… the list goes on and on.  And in shared spaces such as a lecture hall, everyone could have their own display via an app on their phone, so they could see if everyone else is also bored/confused, and – if so – this would take away the hesitancy about asking for clarification.

Not sure how you measure boredom, though – maybe by breathing & pulse rates (slow & steady = falling asleep?).  Maybe confusion leads to stress so this could be detected from skin conductivity.  Worth a grant proposal?",2016-03-20 09:14:02 UTC,,10

Wearable tech might actually cut out a lot of that mediation.

Big Data may not have the high standard of more cumbersome methods of data collection, but as it can be gained quickly, it can still provide an edge to companies concerned and this ease of gathering requires less effort than other more cumbersome methods.

In the work by Goel et al, they predicted what the trends in the music charts were going to be - who's on a rise, who's on a fall etc - and their work seemed to show that was possible. However, what if a 'black swan' event occurs? Take the death of David Bowie. Not generally known that he had cancer, and his passing shocked a generation of most music lovers, and this created a massive upswing in international interest (across the ages) in his discography. Not only did his latest album (Black Star) rocket up the charts, so did many of his earlier classic albums. None of this was predicted, and would have blown away most forecasts. 
So, if we cannot predict a black swan event (which we can't, otherwise it isn't a truly random event), then perhaps we need to be able to develop a 'black swan' mode  - for the above example, simulate the death of ANY major pop star, and be ready to 'recast' our forecasts.",2016-03-21 01:04:55 UTC,,5

I recently went to an international rugby match.  You are part of 50+ thousand people in an enclosed space.  Each individual is different and unique.  But occasionally everyone supporting one of the teams would utter sounds of ecstasy when their side made a try. 

You look at a field of corn.  On a still day, nothing much happens, but a slight breathe will make the leaves sway one way or another - fluctuation in action.

Firstly as the authors say there is positive correlation between GDP and future searches.
Secondly the positive correlation has increased over time, which seems (by eye) to be associated more with a decrease in past searches than an increase in future searches.
I'm uncertain what the interpretation of this means socially, if the eyeball assessment is true e.g. interest in the past has declined, interest in the future remained relatively steady.  This would imply rather than higher GDP countries being more interested in the future, that higher GDP countries have in fact become less interested in the past.  Future searches may have grown less than past searches have declined due to some sort of limitation in the availability, accessibility or capability of acquiring future data.

I appreciate your valid concerns for the future, however, respectfully disagree that control measures are required. As you pointed out the Internet was created to be free and freely utilized. Regulations have been difficult to implement and easily circumvented.

Dataset analysis is a tool, albeit a very powerful tool, that can be used like all tools either constructively or not. Consider the hammer, it can be used to build a house, or as a burglar tool to break into that house. 

Regulations alone do not change actions. Gun regulations have not kept weapons out of the hands of criminals. The ""War on Drugs"" has not stopped drug use.

It is not regulations that we need, but informed and knowledgeable citizens who are aware of the implications of sharing their data and the potential for abuse.  We need to have governments that lead by example. and do not abuse these tools for their own purposes.

But if you replaced the term 'debt' with the term 'profit' or 'boom' the linguistic logic wouldn't hold, assuming you continue to use the strategy of buying when there is more use of that term, when you might expect the price to be higher.

Onto their advertising media spend data across the nation (amount, channel, media broadcaster, days of week, time of day) they overlaid state-by-state weather forecasts (and actual weather reports) and roadworks updates (supplied by auto-membership services organisations) to create a predictive model of when and where people would be most likely to be calling for auto-glass repairs. The details are commercially sensitive, but the company is delighted with what has become a detailed predictive modelling tool specific to their industry.

Another criticism below, is that the technology applications and uses talked of in the mobile / wearables video are trivial, because there are much larger issues we should be trying to fix. All I can say to that is there will always be a tension between invention and innovation. Although the two terms are often used interchangeably, I find it useful to distinguish between them in the following way - invention: creating something new and novel; innovation: looking to use / adapt technology or tools in new way, to solve a problem that the invention was often not originally intended for.
In that way, while Google Glass (as originally invented) was not a commercial success and seemed totally trivial, the tech paved the way for new uses for the masses - wherever 'heads up' displays are useful and practical: motorcycle helmets for example.",2016-03-22 01:14:41 UTC,,0

As we also have an ageing rural / farming population, early research is going into wearable tech connected to the cloud to provide real-time monitoring, self-reporting, and alerts. 
All clinicians & GP's around the country will have real-time access to any patient's medical records, drug use plans, and any other info that will help diagnose and treat a person.

1) 'Apple' and 'apple' may be well-analysable in Google Trends, but our question was about '2001'. Admitting that's harder to analyse, you suggest we ""draw on our intuitions"" of ""how we use [terms like 2001] in everyday life"". But intuitions aren't data, and common sense from one country doesn't necessarily apply to another. You haven't convinced me that comparing 2 arabic numeral search terms is a valid measure of future- v. past- orientation in any generalisable, significantly meaningful sense. 
2) Of comparing 100k Google searches in Russia or China with 1m in the US or an EU country, you say ""obviously, this kind of relative approach works."" What's obvious to me is that you're comparing a minority of Internet users in some countries with the majority in others, which must invalidate any comparative generalisations about their average past- or future- orientation. Russian or Chinese Google(r)s are not representative of typical Internet searche(r)s in their countries.                                             [to be ctd ...]",2016-03-22 18:01:37 UTC,,6

3) ""You could imagine now that you now could rank all the countries according to their degree to which they look towards the future rather than the past."" You could indeed, but it's not what you're actually doing. You're ranking them according to a very restrictive analysis of the comparative frequencies of 2 Google search terms, from which your semantic and psychological generalisations are highly questionable (witness all the questions we asked you!).
4) How many people who search for events like the Olympics do actually use the year as a search term? In 2008 or 2012, any Google search for 'Olympics' would result in links to the Beijing or London events, just as now it returns the Rio one. Suppose you choose to search for 'Olympics Rio', not 'Olympic 2016'. Before you can even finish typing 'Olympics', Google predictively prompts you to search for 'Olympics 2016' as well as 'Olympics Rio'. If you select the former, does your contribution to the data in Google Trends indicate any generalisable future-orientation on your part? Obviously not!

So in my first posts, I challenged its replies to our Week 1 questions. If those posts seemed arrogant, the feelings that went with them weren't. I'm enjoying this opportunity to engage with big data arguments in a small research context. As a result, I'm starting to formulate some challenges to the hypothesis of a link between GDP and future-orientation, based only on Google Trends. It seems to me that a more thorough investigation of what people set out thinking they're going to search for, as opposed to the search terms they actually click on, is needed. And this is because Google Trends is part of a massive self-predictive machinery that prompts users with search terms to click on, before they've clearly formulated any orientations of their own. In simple terms, my hypothesis is that Google searchers are neither past- nor future-oriented; they are Google-oriented. What Google predicts they are searching for is what they will click on - at least often enough to require factoring into our data analysis.",2016-03-22 19:00:57 UTC,,7

• Preparation: I work as a sign language interpreter. MOOCs are preparation for working with Deaf clients in higher education. Sadly even at third year degree level tutors' materials have a paucity.

• Promotional. I audit pre-university MOOCs with a view to recommending them to clients about to enrol in higher education.

• Professional. A few are there for my professional development. Or to catch up with state-of-the-art in domains I once worked in.

• Personal. Some are there because I want to know about a subject or develop my skills.

• Parallel. Some personal/professional topics can turn into preparational.

It is for this reason why we see crime patterns emerge. They are transient and a good analyst (when they are not bogged down with major crime) should be tuned into spotting them. Community policing is crucial therefore to understand who is operating in these areas who might be responsible for the criminal activity. What ruines this is when crime overlaps police force boundaries and hot spots are missed because police forces are not talking to each other hence why a big data solution is a must for the future.

Does Google Trends analysis exclude the past- or future- orientations of people in their 80s and 90s, who don't much use the Internet? While anecdotal evidence might persuade us that people approaching the end of their lives tend to become more preoccupied with their pasts, my hypothesis is that the search terms they choose will be determined - to the same extent as are younger people's - by the proliferation of prompts provided by Google as soon as you start typing in its search box. The Internet is a point-and-click interface, constantly feeding-back its own big data trendings into instant suggestions for further point-and-clicking. Even the most self-determined searchers spend a significant amount of their online time Googling links they weren't at all oriented towards, till Google Trends introduced them. Should Google Trends show older people to be future-oriented, would our common sense association of old age with nostalgia be in error?

Today's 'Hong Kong hotel' searches are unlikely to correlate with the majority of tomorrow's Hong Kong arrivals, or with the majority arriving one year from today. In analysing the data, we are looking to correlate averages, about which our assumptions must be clear for our interpretations to be meaningful or useful. Chou and Varian's research fits our intuitive understanding of real-world, goal-oriented Googling much more readily than did the earlier assumption that people searching for last year are 'past-oriented', whereas people searching for next year are not.

When one network (or organ) struggles to function, other networks adapt. In this adaptive time, the networks (or body) still appears to function.

So, can Big Data diagnose the illness in its 'adaptive' time.

It confirms my worst fears about the reality of some aspects of so-called wealth creation that seems to pander to the notion that making money, rather than making things, is the ultimate aim. I always, perhaps naively, liked to think that investment was all about entrepreneurship, funding someone or a new idea to produce something or provide a service, while at the same time adding value - which resulted in a profit. What exactly does all this trading in shares contribute? Not many widgets are produced by these trading strategies. I'll get off my hobby-horse. One thing that occurs to me is that if a very clever algorithm is devised that more or less guarantees a profit over the trading period, then someone must loose.

I think what you mean by this is that because tech moves 'on' so quickly. It never has time to be fully culturally integrated before tech moves on. I agree and disagree with this statement, I agree that the time between adoption is shorter (in some cases) but I disagree that your statement is universalisable. 

However I see no relationship between this idea and the idea of rationality and a possible connection technology. I could see why tech changes could become largely led by the emotional needs of humans. Emphasis on the largely though. 

I do think humans do at times attempt to rationalise decisions and turn them into a coherent and seemingly rational narrative. But I also think it is a mistake to suppose that those explanations are never founded upon rational specifically logical reasoning. It is in this nuanced view that I fundamentally disagree with Helen. I think she is making a reductive argument because humans frequently do make reductive arguments without careful consideration.

Predicting behavioural outcomes is not the same as becoming behavioural outcomes. I do think with progress AI could become capable of having emotions programmed into their systemic parameters but that is entirely different to big data becoming irrational somehow. If honest I'm not sure how big data could become irrational. Only the interpretation of data could be irrational but taught procedures to people should largely overturn such instances. Over interpretation rather than staightforward reporting evidence is or can be a mistake. And it is acknowledged in good analysis and reporting training that this can be a problem at times. 

It will always occur, but not every time, and not as frequently as some people want to believe. Why people want to believe it or its polarity is an important question in and of itself. And to me is probably indicative of an underlying rational or irrational motive. ",2016-03-23 15:35:36 UTC,,1

Data on risk would also be important. Though more important perhaps is the human assessment of the implications of that risk and the trust placed in the validity of risk-data. It seems to be accepted that misjudgement of risk was a primary cause of the Credit Crunch and subsequent global banking crisis.

1) For what period are search-based predictions valid and reliable? ""Search-based predictions are strongly correlated with realized outcomes for movies (0.85) and video games (0.76) and moderately correlated for music (0.56), where in each case revenue or rank is predicted on the day immediately preceding the event of interest. Moreover, [...] the predictive power of search persists as far out as several weeks in advance—for example, four weeks prior to a movie’s release search volume remains highly correlated (0.75) with opening weekend revenue.""
2) Are we making valid and reliable assumptions about what orientation, intent or purpose is signified of users by the searches they initiate? ""In certain domains searching may be more closely tied to the measured outcomes than in others. For example, it may be the case that movie searches are primarily intended to locate theaters or to purchase tickets online—activities directly related to box-office revenue—whereas music searches may simply reflect interest in a song’s lyrics, as opposed to any intent to purchase it.""

Yet this difficulty does not seem insurmountable in all our pragmatic Week 2 examples. Even if not all searches for a movie title signify intention to go see it within a week, it's no stretch to imagine the ratio of those that do to those that don't staying roughly constant when the overall total goes up, which is all we need to account for the predictive significance we see reliably demonstrated. The authors admit that, where music searches are concerned, differences in the data are harder to interpret. So they hedge their bets: ""The reasons for these intriguing differences are ultimately unclear and suggest the need for further work."" Contrast their caution here with some of the overconfident speculations in the Week 1 roundup, which a) identified '2009' and '2011' as queries sufficient to establish psychological orientations in time; b) treated their Google Trends as a measure of the degree to which ""inhabitants of a country are looking forward rather than backwards""; and c) correlated this with that country's GDP, as if with a cause.",2016-03-24 00:06:41 UTC,,2

Umut (below) mentions Brexit, and we might try to envisage ways of interpreting queries to indicate how people will vote (bearing in mind how hard it is to derive a user's orientation or intent from search terms which, as Umut points out, could be contra-indicative; or as I said before, could be terms used for no other reason than that Google appeared them).
But I'd go with Taleb, and say that an utterly unpredictable Black Swan landing in Europe to dramatic effect between now and the referendum would put all safe bets off.

We are just considering information gathered online and on Google searches. Besides the fact that Google make suggestions as we type in our searches, altering the natural search results, we have to consider people that doesn't use Google as a main search source and people that doesn't have access to internet at all and how they make their searches either. 
Bottom line: The information Google provides us can be used with a high degree of accuracy in some regions, but not in others. For this reason, Google can not be used as a mean of gathering worldwide data.

Andrew Wakefield was struck off the medical register here in the UK http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8695267.stm because he made statistical inferences that he was not qualified to make. Grabbing Google Trends data in JSON via a couple of pre-written functions is one thing but going on to make valid predictions from such data acquisition is not trivial. Trivial maybe to download and install sophisticated stats functions but in the hands of people with no statistical training or knowledge it is Wakefield and Waney Squier http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/21/doctor-waney-squier-denies-shaken-baby-syndrome-struck-off-misleading-courts all over again.

I'd like to suggest another Big Data contradiction, prompted by Riccardo's concern that, in the wired global village, ""everybody knows anyone else's life."" In fact, the social mediation of everybody's life generates too much information for the self-centred individual psyche to exploit. The scale on which Big Data is significant is more along the lines Steve indicates - essentially anonymous bulk averages for social policy and planning. Long before there was an Internet of computers (let alone of Things), the demand for accountability in giant bureaucracies (eg the EEC) had pushed so much paper into public offices, that it became an impossible trial to make sense of it all (though poor Franz Kafka tried).

The model may be flawed/incomplete or an approximation but it consistently delivers the same result for the same input. Not sure what we have seen so far is treating human behaviour in the same way. I think what is being done is more akin to curve fitting to a series of data points and then extrapolating or finding apparent associations between empirical data sets. The problem I suspect is lurking out of sight and ready to pounce on the unwary, is that whereas, for instance, the behaviour of a physical system is governed/constrained by fundamental laws of nature (physics?) human behaviour is not - people may and do behave differently on different occasions to ostensibly the same situation.

'The broken windows theory is a criminological theory of the norm-setting and signaling effect of urban disorder and vandalism on additional crime and anti-social behavior. The theory states that maintaining and monitoring urban environments to prevent small crimes such as vandalism, public drinking, and toll-jumping helps to create an atmosphere of order and lawfulness, thereby preventing more serious crimes from happening.'

Even the law gives scope for juvenile offenders to redeem certain bad acts through community service.

So the team's strategy is basically to look for a rise in the number of financial search terms on Google and then 'sell short' - sell shares they haven't got, with the intention of buying them a week later when the price will have fallen. The profit comes in making the sale at the higher price and then later buying at a lower price. 

(And the opposite case, if people are searching less than usual, they are less likely to be selling, so prices are more likely to rise - because prospective buyers will have to persuade them to sell stocks when they hadn't intended doing so. )

Is this hypothesis mistaken? Are there things we'll do in R that can't be done in RStudio?

I am not sure who coined the term ""wealth creation"" and whether they had intended it to apply to making paper money,  but to be fair to economists, are trying to optimize the use of resources and not money - and that means more value added.  I think this may have got lost in the modern day as I think I even heard Tobias talking about economists being concerned with ""money"" earlier on in this course.    We should always remember that money in and of itself is worthless and just a proxy for resources - which really exist.

So we can waste a lot of time trying to figure out whether A is causing B or vice versa, when in fact A and B are both consequences of a hidden variable C (of which we're ignorant). I recommend a reading of at least the introductory chapter of the pop stats book, 'Freakonomics', for a riveting glimpse into ""the hidden side of everything"". It starts with a fascinating and provocative case study of the dramatic early- to mid-nineties fall in crime rates in U.S. cities, where everyone had been expecting crime to keep rising. Correlated with the fall in some cities (eg New York) were dramatic new zero tolerance methods of policing, whose proponents were quick to take causal credit for the crime wave reversal. But were they right?

Surely Big Data is only immediate now because it's a relatively recent development?

My impression living and working in China is that people in general follow many deeply traditional beliefs and practices, for all the main life events (births, weddings and funerals). These are reflected in the national holidays, and the things families and friends do together on these occasions. A very important one is coming up soon, called Tomb Sweeping:

I often ate at Hui restaurants in Beijing, Xian and Zhengzhou. Their entrances are usually green, decorated with both Chinese and Arabic calligraphy, and of course, unlike most Chinese restaurants, they don't serve pork.
Some of my best musician friends in Beijing were Uyghur people who had come to Beijing from Xinjiang. In their music and language, you can hear the Persian and Arabic influence which must have travelled up the Silk Road in ancient times. Here is a video I made for them at a small bar in Beijing, where they played every night. The song is called Ash Najan, and tells of a Xinjiang Uyghur, far from home and missing his love:

But anger also involves changes in facial expression and posture and those are more covert.  Collective behaviour is about finding the overt and readily observable trends of groups of people. 

Predicting human behaviour is difficult because it seems to be more often based on emotion than rational processes.  Human beings can undergo rapid state changes so emotions can change swiftly.  Human beings are inconsistent and can behave one way on one day and another way on the next.  Humans will also behave inconsistently if it becomes apparent to them that their behaviour is being anticipated or is being prompted.

I definitely agree that there is a strong correlation between the vocabulary we have and the capacity to articulate the complexity and nuanced nature of our thoughts and experience of the world. 

I tend to think that awareness or how I frequently term it 'informed consent' about something, better enables us to avoid such incidences of bias. 

So for example, knowledge of  the fact that during court proceedings judges, juries etc are more likely to have a bias in favour of symmetrical faces, means that at least in some cases those judging/evaluating a case/person, will be in a better informed position to separate out their inclination towards an aesthetic bias, from the evidence. Of course some may fail others won't, but informing of that variable will invariably reduce that bias in some people.

Knowing whether a person makes a choice for unbiased reasons is a difficult question to answer in itself, and asks deep questions about what can we know about reasons for choices.

Next, most burglary is opportunistic and likely coincident with the daily routine of the burglar.If their routine takes them outside areas of high betweenness then they may find themselves working freely in areas with a low police presence.

Next, this sort of analysis will result in a more visible police presence in a given area. This will deter crime but the criminals will simply move on to a new area. 

So I think that any model needs to take a lot more in to account than just betweenness and be constantly updated to take in to account new trends. There will always be exceptions in any model and police should also be adaptable to that.

Likewise, weather forecasting tries to predict conditions of another complex system. Indeed, we can build a parallelism between the two: people and weather. People are widespread all over and so there is a weather condition for a particular location all over the places. What people's behaviour affect others will depend upon interaction (time and place). The same with weather: initial conditions in one place in time will have an effect on its neighboring location then and after. I would call this particular trait a diffussion effect. And depending upon previous conditions, posterior conditions will grow or decline.  The equivalent of initial conditions for the weather would be the system of principles, values, and institutions of human society. Possibly, principles may tend to be fixed, but values and institutions evolve over time at different rates at different locations.

The English language has a long history of adaptive behaviour precisely because people on the ground, using language adapt and change it and ignore at time the cynical overly critical grammar attitude that holds back adaptation to a constantly changing linguistic and cultural environment. 

I tend to hold with Wittgenstein that meaning in the context of usage is what is important. If we are able to sufficiently confer reasonable meaning with the words we utter, then we have sufficiently met the criteria of the 'real world' grammar of the language landscape.

One outcome was that when women were pregnant (which could be determined by them shopping for a significant amount of baby gear), they tend to buy certain products that didn't necessarily relate to raising a baby, like aspirin or certain lotions. Thus, if a woman was purchasing a certain amount of baby gear, display an advertisement for the other products, as well. One pattern that I have picked up on as a new dad was that a lot of new fathers make their own lunch in order to save money, for which they buy Tupperware or lunchboxes and certain groceries.

It reminded me that several years ago, I read a little about socionomics, defined as the study of the relationship between social mood and social behavior. The theory was that social mood influences the overall performance of the economy, financial markets and politics. It was extremely interesting, if not a little 'tidy'.
There was a book released called 'The Elliot Wave Principle', read more about it here: https://books.google.co.nz/books/about/Elliott_Wave_Principle.html?id=Qy9aqeZ0Kq8C&redir_esc=y&hl=en. 
The original 'Elliot Wave Principle' seems to predate 'Big Data', other multi-discipline concepts such as physics & economics, or other discussions around 'rare events' to look for patterns and predict movements in the stock market.
My questions are:
1. Does anyone know whether the field of socionomics has ever been accepted and become mainstream, or discredited.

Those brokerage fees can add up rapidly and even when you do successfully trade, taxes will eat up a portion of your profits.

The pedways provided easy escape routes for criminals (usually muggers, burglars). New blocks were constructed with  controlled front door entrances. It was simple, but effective. Later measures were to introduce alley gates. Both measures blocked of escape routes for criminals.

Hopefully, we will discuss how searches for information that may have a major impact upon an industry at a category level, (not merely for specific companies) may be able to be measured and used as early predictors of stock market movements.

1.  XYZ Lab announces it has developed high range, swift charging battery tech for vehicles.
2. Public search response: searches increase for that lab, and battery tech.

The first obstacle is probably the biggest. Are we rational agents?
Behavioural Economics talks variously about how people are irrational, or they act with 'bounded rationality', and most recently it is proposed  that both of these statements are incorrect, because we are all agents in some highly complex (but theoretically provable) quantum pattern of behaviour. Read more about this (quantum cognition) here: http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/09/how-quantum-cognition-can-explain-humans-irrational-behaviors/405787/
In the meantime behavioural science has identified in excess of 150 human cognitive biases and heuristics, that cause us to behave differently depending upon the strength of those biases and heuristics within each of us. However, as we become part of a larger group, herd, or society, the matrix of our collective behavioural options are greatly expanded.
Add to that, huge cultural differences in the world, especially between the power of ""Me"" Vs the power of the collective ""We"".

This might sound all very 'wooly' but with finite and diminishing resources we have to look at new ways of policing and if such analysis is effective in identifying these areas then it could be treated as a golden opportunity for the police to take the lead in thinking outside the box and getting other interested agencies and organisations to start working collaboratively.  ,2016-03-29 10:28:36 UTC,,7

Big Data analysis, done by fast adaptive algorithms, might enable artificial subroutines to develop successful strategies in unpredictable futures. But the poor little human conscience can attend to perhaps 6-7 concepts any given moment, which it selects from stereotypes and superstitions more naturally than from logic or reason. So any intuitive grasp we might have, of what Big Data is up to and why the behavioural patterns it reveals occur, is likely to be redundant and obsolete long before we've managed to get it down into a Tweet-sized, human-friendly synopsis. 
The folks who'll drive Big Data engines at breakneck speed towards maximum market advantage have no interest in how and why it works, only that it does. Until it doesn't.

Some of us then argue that the research in the video is flawed by its failure to analyse the search terms properly, and its lack of a causal hypothesis to explain why strategies based on it might actually work. As Trevor points out, the only hypotheses the researchers venture to offer are those Sybil Fawlty could have given us, when interrogated on Mastermind in her special subject, the Bleedin' Obvious!

A crude approach, in the spirit of big data, would be to use Google's n-gram feature https://books.google.com/ngrams that allows one to investigate the popularity of a word over time (from 1700 to 2008). For example the often confused words imply and infer have waxed and waned over that period; used intensively in the 1700s but dropping off until the mid 1859s when infer nosedives and imply picks up.

One can say that at a particular time split infinitives were not allowed and now they are. Actually a look at English over time tells us that split infinitives were always allowed … by the people who used English. The only people who say one cannot infinitive split are grammarians who wish that Latin was the lingua franca of the world; it's a language that is impossible to split infinitives in because there is no auxiliary word to denote the infinite form of a word as there is in English.

It' a rigorous piece of well-thought out research which takes care to define all its terms and relations, account for its own scope and limitations, and avoid generalising from its results to hypotheses in areas they don't warrant. David and others are right that a word like 'debt' (or by implication a topic called 'business') could signal different intentions in the minds of searchers, and might signal a market move up or down. But 'could' and 'might' don't count so much once the research can establish that ""increases in search volumes for topics related to politics and business or finance tend to precede falls in the stock market."" Of course, being human, we then start trying to hypothesise why. ""And there's different possible explanations. One possible explanation is that humans are loss averse.""

Hence the link between a rise in searches and selling short and, conversely, buy and hold when search volumes were low. 

I do wonder if there was any attempt to identify and balance negative and positive terms though. 'Debt' is strongly linked to financial queries no doubt - but it also has strong negative connotations. I just wonder if there was any attempt to distinguish proportions of negative ('debt') versus positive ('invest'?) terms in the data.

I think the kinds of behaviours that are easy to predict are those that:

- Have been consistently repeated in the past
- We have good reason to suppose will continue to be repeated in the future, barring extreme events.

The behaviour of a group of people will be more pronounced when more of the people in the group behave in the right kind of way. So in the case of the rush hour there need to be enough people trying to get somewhere at the same time.

So, I would say collective behaviours that are easier to predict are those that are:
- Very regular
- Very easy to observe
- Caused by the individual behaviours of a significant proportion of the population.

Collective behaviours that are more difficult to predict are those where any one or all of the following is true:
- Less regular

Grammar schools taught Latin grammar, then tried to force its rules on English usage. So, no split infinitives, and never end a sentence with a preposition. To which Churchill retorted, ""Quite right - that's the sort of English up with which we should not put!""
The fact that these prescriptions were imposed by elite schools to correct regional dialects (eg Bristolian: ""Where's that book to?"") is evidence that one of the key movers in prescribing grammar is power. Grammar is class politics! 
However, Bill and I might give 2 retorts when Trevor says ""grammar should never be prescriptive"":
1) Philosophical: Trevor's judgment is itself a prescription about what grammar should be (cf Ayer's principle of verifiability failing its own test);
2) Pragmatic: Standards for speaking and conventions for writing are as significant a factor in any language culture as change. Teaching language and literature is presciptive.
In synthesis, language usage resolves a dynamic tension between forces of conservatism and moments of change. Linguistics, as a social science of language, offers no objective basis for a normative judgment of one in favour of the other.

Warchalking some sap's home WiFi router gets them in trouble and the criminal gets away scot free.

Either that or the criminal uses encrypted tunnels to obfuscate their entry and exit from the network. It is the basis of the Tor browser and system (originally set up with CIA funding) and what is now referred to as ""the dark web"".

Mind you when I use T-Mobile as my mobile Internet provider the IP addresses I appeared to be using were in Germany. When I worked in the London office of a major computer manufacturer the IP addresses I appeared to be using were in the US.

I suppose the aim is to make each hotspot less attractive.  Although this would lead to crime moving elsewhere, it would take time for criminals to do the legwork and figure out the best targets and escape routes each time they switch to a new area - and this would cause a temporary drop in crime overall.  Repeating this hotspot-targeting often enough would mean that the legwork-time, and likelihood of getting caught, would make burglary less and less attractive as a source of income.

Along with other people, I think the ‘big brother’ aspects raise worrying questions – but we, as a society, have to consider how we weigh this loss of privacy against the very real trauma many people suffer from being burgled or mugged.

The drawback is obvious. That accountants and bureaucrats wanting to push savings made even lower will take it too far and want to rely on the computer analysis only.
The best way is for old fashioned human patrolling and maintaining profile be complemented by computer analysis. So I would say 'prediction' is too strong a word.

Still, it's hard to pin down what exactly distinguishes human behaviour from that of a physical system, because humans are governed and constrained by fundamental laws of physics too. It's just that we seem to find ways of appearing to get over or around them, by understanding them and the limitations they impose on us, then harnessing this understanding in astonishing new technologies, which yet soon become second nature to subsequent generations. I can fly around the world; or communicate instantaneously with you anywhere upon it, pinpointing your location from a godlike orbit. But even doing these things, I'm ruled by the Physics I cannot escape.
Our applied theories transform our environments, feedback from which transforms our old theories, leading to new applications which transform ... strange loopings of mutual causation which we can't disentangle. What does Free Will mean in the context of quantum cognition (cf Lee's link, below)?

The dangers are I guess if criminals start to recognise patterns in police presence [so if someone watching a house observes that police don't drive by twice within 20 minutes].

We probably also need to be concious of unreported crime - let's say we only allocate police to places where crimes are predicted with reasonable likelihood (so nowhere has a baseline police presence) but there's some corner of the city where crime happens but is never reported. If police never go there, there's no opportunity to 'discover' unreported crime, so you'd expect it to flourish.",2016-03-30 11:48:54 UTC,,3

So one danger is that in shifting resources into crime hot-spots, we reduce police presence in areas where crime is low - and the deterrence effect of police presence there might be precisely what is keeping crime low.

Once the criminal class recognise that the police are focusing on areas where crime has already happened, there is a risk that they will make use of this knowledge by waiting for reduction of policing in 'low-risk' areas before moving in. It would make sense then for them to hit one area heavily for a very brief period - one or two days say - before laying low for a period and/or switching to another area. 

Also, under the current dominant political philosophy of Western countries, the suggestion that data analysis might mean more effective policing will convert pretty quickly into cuts in resources on the grounds of expected 'efficiency savings'.

Stefan, although I did pay for one certificate - the very first FutureLearn MOOC (Soton's Web Science) - I don't see what they can show a potential employer (or educator) that a link to your profile can't show just as well. To this end, if I start but don't complete a MOOC, I click ""Leave this course"" and it disappears from my public profile. A certificate of completion merely certifies that you've turned enough pink circles blue to have finished that course. It gives no measure of how attentively you did this, or what you learned in the process. Even where there is an end-of-course test, if you've only half paid attention to the materials, you're likely to pass it. In any case, the certificates don't show scores when you do (correct me if I'm wrong please, Trevor!).

I jumped off the train last night and suddenly took note of some of the tagging graffiti near and around the station on the way to my car.  Firstly I thought about motivation. Tagging usually is a place that needs to be visible.  It is an act of ego. Unlike the burglar, the tagged is on foot, and therefore connective pathways are important. Good visibility of who might see you, so you can move away. Tagging tends to occur near other tags, so I guess the canvas is already defined.
Data that could be used includes mobile signals along train lines. Ie where people aren't meant to be. Maybe tracking mobile phones being turned off near a location and subsequently on and the occurrence of tagging. I thought drone surveillance along key targets such as trains lines and industrial estates.  Paint sales and distribution of aerosols into key trouble spots. Evidence in discarded paint sprays gives a strong indication of who sold the paint.  This will put pressure on the sellers to do the right thing.  If this all misses the mark, introduce strong removal policies. Ie. No tag along train line lasts more than 2 days. Bust the ego.",2016-03-30 20:48:02 UTC,,5

My experience is not as extensive as yours, but houses with less social control (close to a park, wood, or with a lot of bushes) experienced a higher number of burglaries in the city where I lived. 
A very strange case was a street with high hedges (over 2 meters high) in front of all the houses : lots of burglaries, but only there. 
Another strange one was a high appartment-building taken down, leaving an empty space. The school next to it was left without social control and eventually a wing was burned down.
So in the end it is not only about policing, but about visibility, social control and escape-routes.

And this phenomenon does not exist only nowdays  or the last 3-4 decades, but it was always the foundational ""gene"" of capitalism in his liberal or neoliberal form. Also there many forms of capitalist societies e.g. scandinavian welfare states from one hand, USA in contrary.

Actually, our MOOC strategies are not so very different. I've also got two unfinished MOOCs on my profile, because I intend to finish them (either as cold cases or when they run again). 
I've also been very impressed by the initial enthusiasm and scope of some first-run MOOCs I've tried, and in contrast very disappointed in the slack quality of some others.
Do you also find there's quite a range in the number of hours you feel you need to do to stay on top of the materials provided?

There are big data issues of course. How accurate are the educators effort estimates? The web analytic trackers attached to pages here would provide FL and educators with bounce rate, dwell rate, conversion rate statistics. Dwell time is probably the most useful as it could be seen as a measure of the time students need to use for each step. Conversion rate could be viewed as whether participants buy a certificate or perhaps more meaningfully did they mark a page as completed and then progress to the next one. There are people like me who would skew those analytics because we use adblockers but FL could still extract the relevant data from their web server's own logfiles.

Obtaining reliable crime stats begs many fundamental questions which I'm sure we'll be exploring in the Week 4 Comments. Here's one that caused the Home Office to initiate the British Crime Survey: How can we obtain useful estimates of unreported crimes to add to those included in the official police records? And here's another that plagues the British Crime Survey method: How can we account for the fact that people don't always tell the truth when asked about their experiences of crime?

Paolo, the police would still rush out to a burglary in process at an odd-numbered house; they just wouldn't follow it up with a forensic investigation.
House burglaries are nearly always reported, as you need to file a police report to claim on your insurance. The police figures might even be higher than the actual number of burglaries.
Theft from cars, on the other hand, may be significantly under-reported. The first time a thief smashed my car window shortly after the Zombie Apocalypse, I dutifully spent 2-3 hours down at the station with PC Data, filling in forms. Afterwards, he told me there'd be no point in fingerprinting my car, as there were too many incidents for his human resources to keep up with. He advised me to ""Go down the High Street and look for your stuff in Crack Converters*."" I did, and three months later I found it. So I called up PC Data, and he came down and claimed it back for me. The shopkeeper tried to say my mates must've sold it to him as part of a scam. PC Data didn't arrest him.

For normal crime like burglary, sex offense, violence and so on we have our legal system, where somebody is innocent until proven guilty. 
However, when it comes to the suspicion(!) of terrorism, money laundring or related crimes with a financial component, Big Data is already used heavily. 
Apart from false negatives (missing a crime), we have false positives too (think about serious mail ending up in your gmail spam-folder - fortunately reversibel). 
Sometimes accounts or credit cards will be blocked automatically. Banks and other companies will follow their own rules and blacklists are very persistant. 
The result might be the opposite of Blackstone's formulation (  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackstone's_formulation ): Something like ""It is better that ten accounts of innocent people will be blocked, than one terrorist being able to transfer money"".

I was so upset, I came back here without re-securing it. What was the point? Everything had gone.

6 months since, and I've only just finished the insurance listing (a truly depressing bureaucratic chore!) and started daring to return to face the music. Music I can't make anymore (cue the violin, no wait, they stole it!).

So, is there any way to distinguish between show-time searches and review searches - does it matter? Furthermore, what is the effect of advertising? Constant publicity of films, on TV, or continued playing of particular tracks on BBC radio (advertising gone mad).

It does suggest an ethical issue is involved. As ability to control Google searches increases much power is going to be placed into the hands of a few corporations and individuals.

More kudos in being seen to implement 'innovative techniques' rather than traditional good policing perhaps?

Also, an important dimension missing from this analysis is people - and that's pretty much central to good policing. Local police know the local scallywags; know who's started associating with whom, know when a new face appears, who's been seen a few times off their local patch, what their specialisms are, who's been quiet for a while - and so on.

So an 'impersonal computer' would be that human-machine scenario without the people-friendly pretence (or pretention!). Combining all these nuances, what I had in mind above was people sitting at screens impersonally computing nameless aggregate data to make crude predictions about other people in general (because in practice, most big data computing does obscure individual identities, both from both the human-coded algorithms, and from the humans interpreting their results in natural language).

The times suggested by FutureLearn usually underestimate how long you need to do justice to the MOOC materials and learn something from them. Let's take this Week 3 of Big Data, for example. Dividing 15 activities over 3 hours gives me an average of 12 minutes per activity. But some of the videos alone are close to that long, and people with no programming experience can't possibly do the R tasks in 12 minutes. In some MOOCs, you can race through a week's worth of screen texts and videos in 3 hours, with just enough time to glance at the 'Most Liked' Comments and quickly post one of your own. But that's ignoring the 'further reading' and other additional links most MOOCs also include, plus all the interesting developments linked to by folks in the Comments.

1) What crime? Watching Toby's talk in full on YouTube it's clearer that he's mostly talking about burglary. Odd that the term 'crime' is used in general in so many studies, when that term blurs and obscures such a wide range of differences in how best to collect and interpret statistics.
2) Street policing? Ending his long YouTube lecture, Toby says ""Noone really knows what the effect of policing is when you put it into a model like this.""
3) What criminal?  Awareness spaces assume stereotypes of local opportunistic criminals (in this case burglars on foot?). But just as 'crime' covers a wide range and variety, so must 'criminal'.
4) Cul-de-sacs, alleys, parks and gardens? Toby's street-networked analysis of 'betweenness' may be an improvement on Euclidian proximity-based diffusion, but burglars on foot who grew up locally (garden creeping as boys!) know other shortcuts and escape routes. Need separate models for burglars on foot versus in vans?
5) Beyond local areas: Instead of link-betweenness (streets), node-betweenness (public transport) could be used to model wider ranging crime/criminals. Eg use London Oyster card data.",2016-04-01 17:50:19 UTC,,1

A crime wave hits the streets of his local town. PC Data finds himself running a different model to analyse past frequencies and future diffusion patterns for each different category of crime; then resetting the parameters and running the models again for different types of criminal. Police HQ fills up with computers, programmers, network analysts, statisticians, sales reps and cardboard boxes. Bobbies are recalled from the beat and sent for IT awareness retraining. One night, PC Data awakes sweating like a chemist from a dream of snaky circularities: The IT retraining caused by the crime wave is now causing a crime wave even harder to analyse! On an IT-free retreat to a crime-free Amish community, PC Data has an epiphany: Putting more community police on the streets reduces the frequencies of most crimes! ""Carry this to its logical conclusion!"" thinks our hero; and so reduces the local ratio of officers to citizens to 1:1. Not only can the former surveil the latter at all times, but police and thieves can swap roles at the weekend, to keep the game fresh. Dare PC Data dream of a day when every citizen polices itself?

Likewise, criminals are a diverse bunch of types scattered through every kind of community we might want to police. No comment I've read here yet has gone deep into the nature-nurture dimension of criminality, but there too we'll find a whole range of complex correlating causalities to disentangle. Yet we'll have to, if we're to succeed in understanding crime well enough to predict and prevent its many forms. 
Having said all that, your question of whether it is fair or not to keep watching people who have paid their debts to society may be somewhat academic, as it seems we're all being watched anyway, criminal record or not!",2016-04-01 21:36:13 UTC,,2

A physical newspaper only presents you with what the publisher wants you to see. Online you get to see what you want, view it from different sources and perspectives, on demand and in real time.

An online edition can include audio and video segments as well as text, something that is not possible with the printed page.

Then there is the fact that you are being tracked transparently and providing instant feedback to the publisher about what you find of interest as well as where you are located, what time you are reading, how long you are reading. The digital format can be easily supported through the sale of your information as well as through directed ads. It has the added advantage of being able to be easily stored and preserved providing an archive of news events for future use.  The online media is a win-win both for the consumer and publisher.

Consider the metaphorical mapping of PERSONS to PARTICLES in a WAVE which maps back either to HISTORY or LANGUAGE (depending on what you want to figure out). Remember: metaphors obscure as much information as they clarify. Example: in STEM teaching, electric circuits can be imagined as water flowing though canals, or horses running round race tracks. These different analogies draw out different aspects of our knowledge of electric circuits; but in the process each blanks out aspects just as important. In the YouTube video, Neil warns that metaphorising persons as particles ignores a very significant dimension. Fundamental particles are all identical to one another in all our scopes, and measure key constants which are all conserved.

On the other, social media playing a significant role in circumventing state media censorship across the Middle East (the Arab Spring?)

Seriously, I am suspending my own natural resistance to some of what I am reading / hearing, because as we all know, human behaviour is driven by bounded rationality, or if the latest thinking is to be believed, quantum cognition - in other words, we behave in irrational ways, and our behaviours are difficult to predict.
Having said all that, my interest is piqued by what seems to be a big contradiction in this week's videos - Tobias and Suzy have both said that, unlike natural systems e.g the weather  where our attempt to forecast / predict it will have no impact upon the natural system, human behaviour is so difficult to predict because we may change the way we behave, precisely because of our attempts to predict it.

Thus, collective behaviour of members of any particular group or association (political or social) is relatively easy to predict, rather than collective behaviour of random groupings.
2.Cause-effect relationship of weather (which has been studied intensively) is more simple and straightforward than the human behaviour. 
Moreover, we are talking about forecasting the weather of the Earth, which is an element of a (single) study subject, while 'human behaviour' inorporates variables of several different subjects. So, this is not the most relevant comparison.

By pinpointing areas that are most likely to be hit by repetitive crimes such as burglaries, the police could on the one hand have a more visible presence in terms of patrols and beat cops, but on the other, and arguably more sustainable in metro / urban areas where people do not seem to know their neighbor, help bring communities  / streets / neighbours together more through initiatives such as 'neighborhood watch' etc.
Also, surely when enough data has been sampled to show that the betweenness modelling is valid - time should be spent on looking for those areas that based upon this, should be targets, but have yet to fall victim of burglaries.
This may be helpful in 3 ways:
1. Try and discover what is different about those areas that should be 'victims' but aren't, Vs those that should be, and are.
2. Once the differences have been found, try and introduce them into the areas that have been hit.

There are always invasive species, species will as I am sure you know, alter the species balance. I don't think the view that we should preserve a species when it is incapable of competing is that reasonable. My view is if it can adapt it will and if not it will die out.

All our positions in debates like these are lines drawn in sands which the philosophical mind seeks to shift by careful choice of argument and example. If you adopt a position on grey squirrels based on emotional attachment to reds (and I do know this 'you' isn't you, Alex!), then as a philosopher I might first press you to justify that position in rational terms. And as you do, I might beg questions about the implicit assumptions you're making, and try to draw them consciously out till some self-evident contradiction appears.

All the 'cycles' we learned about in school (carbon, water, nitrogen, etc) are to a significant degree interactions of the inorganic prior 'universe' and all the 'organisms' that have emerged into, and therefore transformed it.

On the other hand, Man was never fundamentally happy if the river took its natural course away from where he wanted water to make things grow. Our earliest civilisations were built on an agricultural revolution which refused to let some nature take its course. To some, letting nature take its course meant going AWOL from the War against Death! 
Aye, and there's the rub; it's essential to the nature of organisms to resist nature's course for as long as we can. We feed ourselves to stop it (at the expense of the lives of other organisms, even as vegetarians!).
So again, two opposing tendencies (Eros & Thanatos, Yin & Yang?) must co-exist in the dynamic tension which is inevitably the life of any biological organism.

This is the code on question 4:

for (year in (2008:2014)) {
        for (month in (1:12)) {

            if ((year == 2014) && (month > 10)) {next}

            theURL <- ""http://stats.grok.se/json/en/""	
            theURL <- paste0(theURL, year)

            if (month < 10) {theURL <- paste0(theURL, ""0"")}

            theURL <- paste0(theURL, month) 
            theURL <- paste0(theURL, ""/Friday"")

            print(theURL)} }

The key is in that line: 

if ((year == 2014) && (month > 10)) {next}

The meaning of that line is the following: if the year is 2014 and the month is higher to 10 (&& means and), the program will skip that loop repetition. So, for example, at November 2011, month number is greater than ten (obviously 11>10), but year is not 2014. So as both conditions aren't fulfilled, the loop repetition won't be skipped, and a URL will be generated for November 2011.

So, you have 2008-2013 complete (6 x 12 = 72), and January to October in 2014 (10 months more, 72 + 10 = 82).

I think your probably right with the water analogy.
But perhaps, there will be a delay before the burglars figure out what is going on.
During that time the police might be able to catch more burglars, who can then be given a firm warning and non custodial sentence.

Further more, there may be patterns of response from the burglarising (that was my spell checker!) community that are predictable. When a community of burglars in one area realises how the police are monitoring, analysing and responding to their behaviour their next moves may be relatively consistent. It might be possible to predict which other areas they will target when they decide not to repeat a job in the same road.

We are thinking about this from the perspective of outcomes, which is sensible.
But we can also consider it from the perspective of police and how they decide what to do and what not to do. 
Unless they choose to only be reactive they need a way of predicting where and when crime will occur. 

I what alternative approaches could the police use to try and predict where crimes might occur?",2016-04-05 07:39:20 UTC,,0

These single one off events generate an explosion of data about that event that will typically run for a few days and then normalise. They can be either negative or positive and they have the most 
profound impact on stock market behaviour.

Some recent negative  examples: 
The death of princess Diana.
The collapse of the twin towers
The 1987 hurricane that hit the UK. 

In each of these scenarios the FTSE 100 collapsed as everyone was trying to dump their shares. Whilst such a behaviour makes sense for the Hurricane and the collapse of the world trade centre, Princess Diana's death had no obvious correlation with the performance of the economy. So this implies that human sentiment is also a major influencer of stock market behaviour.

As a point of observation, these one off events are the best time to buy shares because in most cases, there has been no fundamental change to the underlying performance of each company. It's a systematic impact.

Women were also not recruited into covert ops by the British as the numbers of serving field intelligence officers was very low.

This links below discuss displacement if you want to know more. On an aside this was observed in suicide rates, during periods of economic downturn we see more suicides however when the gas pumped into our homes in the 70's changed (in a period of economic downturn) making it more difficult to commit suicide using the oven, suicide rates dropped and there wasn't an upturn (displacement) for an alternative form of tragically ending ones life.

There was an administrative review of the Language Centre (LC), which strongly praised our integration of English with other languages (all the main European ones for Erasmus/Socrates programs/exchanges, plus Japanese and Chinese), and strongly recommended that our mixed-language learning environment not be broken up. 
So guess what! The Japanese and Chinese languages coordinators were dismissed and their courses closed; European Languages were merged into the old-school French, German, Italian and Hispanic Studies departments (where LC coordinators had to compete with coordinators there for half the number of jobs); and EFL was expanded into a brand new Centre for English Language and Foundation Studies (CELFS).  
It's lovely, modelled on the glass-partitioned learning environments familiar to students in China (where I'd guess most of CELFS' income now comes from). But I wasn't shortlisted for the new full-time EAP/STEM Foundation posts (nothing personal, fair criteria were honestly applied). So I stayed in China in the glass rooms of Wall Street English.

Mark, John, Jenny and Amanda have raised interesting issues below. I'd like to remind us that one problem with the analysis of 'crime' in this week's materials was that it wasn't an analysis of 'crime' at all. At best it was a limited analysis of one kind of crime, some sort of local street burglary - and even that wasn't clearly defined, either in terms of its own characteristics, or those of the criminals assumed to be committing it.
The official police crime statistics divide crimes into very many different categories, across which the geographical and sociological profiles vary dramatically. The British Crime Survey does likewise, but is aimed at clarifying gaps in the police statistics, for example by soliciting accounts of unreported crimes.
I think it would have been better in the earlier videos to replace the generic word 'crime' with a much more specific sub-category (eg 'opportunistic burglary'), so as to inhibit any tendency to overgeneralise from our limited data analysis.",2016-04-06 12:44:51 UTC,,3

With people one person’s behaviour can be difficult to understand and predict but get a million and it sometimes becomes simpler. For example if you take a country that used to think it was the greatest on the planet and expose it to a financial crisis then it suddenly wants to vote for a idiot with crazy ideas and a strange hairstyle. I was thinking of Nazi Germany but maybe it will happen again. Perhaps the answer is in rules.

I actually thought some of these pictures were very nice and rated them accordingly. It's a very different style of building from the ones I'm used to in the UK but once I'd got past the first few pictures and got a handle on what kinds of buildings they were, I found a lot of variation - tidier streets, different coloured paintwork, interesting shutters and a bit of greenery.

I think what made it more difficult is that we're so used here to regarding flat, blocky buildings rendered in a plain colour as automatically ugly, because in Northern Europe most of them are. In warmer countries (eg Italy) you see this kind of building everywhere and it just seems to work.

If this is the case then ill informed news reporting and even social media strings can adversely affect the performance of a soundly run business causing undue problems.

As long as information is anonymized while treated and the results published are about groups larger then 1000 people, then most people access the publishing of such information. Publishing data that could quite easily be backtracked to the individual is seen as very unethical.

A nice example is that the Dutch bureau of statistics collected information about the amount of people that ever made use of psychological help per postcode. One clever engineer created a search engine so that you could put anyone's postcode to see the results and that made it into the newspapers. There was quite some commotion about this, but since postcodes with less then 1000 people in them were excluded, because then it would be too obvious about whom the results would be, people in the end accepted it.

The funny/interesting thing about this data was that many postcodes had a statistic higher then 50%, whilst most people would never admit ever having gone there, since it's quite a taboo.",2016-04-08 14:35:17 UTC,,2

As soon as a model is published, it will be public property and even the inventor is not supposed to change it (it can be done but will be ignored). So presenting a new model, which is adaptive, should show a very thorough, scientifically supported ""apaptation principle"", being a model in itself.

For inluenza the same applied to the Netherlands. The government bought vaccines for about the whole population and a lot of people got their vaccination (I get it every year).

I seem to remember, as a child certain games were almost seasonal, for example marbles, yoyos and other games which though appearing annually had a short life span. Now, fashion is for instance, 'skinny leg', 'regular leg' or 'wide leg'. To have quantities of each tied up in the stockroom or warehouse is expensive. Much better to know/predict what the fashion is and stock those items and then adjust to the next fashion keeping just sufficient stock available to meet the demands of customers. Moreover, once consumer behaviour is predicted it can then be driven in a certain direction; hence fashion shows can promote a particular fashion after which the High Street can purchase appropriate clothing.

Theories have developed into workable models have been as far fetched as ant colony behavior and cancer. Deborah Gordon (TED talk below) has spent 28 years researching ants but she has only recently had the technology to detect intricate behavior which sheds light on what is happening in the system. Experts in fields of study who embrace and are able to make a leap of thought with technology that generate immense amounts of data become multidisciplinary.

Looking at the ARIMA-model ( http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.1988.10478707 ) explains the tests used (statistics are clear), but still not the method applied to improve the model.

On the other hand, we have the real world, with its epidemiological behaviour. We know contagion is more likely following traveling patterns an spreading from a case zero in a certain area. So if search terms grow more than would be likely from an epidemiological perspective, we should set a brake on the model.
I think splitting the data sets over regions (e.g. countries or states) an looking for differences between the possible growth of flu cases against the number of searches, anomalies can be captured. E.g. in a country (state, county) still having a low number of flu cases, the ""hype"" impact in the searches will be comparable to the impact in a country (state, county) with already a lot of flu patients. By comparing both, it will be possible to correct for this effect using a ""stratified"" model, adding regions.

We no longer have a single plague ship in harbour but potentially hundreds of thousands of potential carriers.
Air hubs can be shutdown or passengers screened before take off but I do not think this is very practical.
When an outbreak occurs it is often too late.
The flu virus mutates each year and it is an expensive exercise to stock up and distribute the jabs.
If big data can predict an outbreak it is of huge importance to governments to have an accurate prediction.
I remember queuing for a polio jab with my siblings in the early 60's when it was rampant in Ireland and how worried our parents were about us catching the disease.
Thankfully that disease has been eliminated. ",2016-04-12 09:26:49 UTC,,2

The story of Eyam village in Derbyshire and the fact that it was so exceptional highlights this. For those who don't know the story  In 1665 a bale of cloth was delivered to the village from London. It must have contained bubonic plague carrying fleas. The merchant and 2 of his sons died. Remarkably the local vicar persuaded the villagers to accept strict quarantine even to the extent of not burying their dead in consecrated ground but within the village. The villagers knew that by staying they would not escape the plague but that they would not spread it.  Goods were left by surrounding benefactors at a 'plague stone' boundary and the villagers left money to pay for the essentials. 1/3rd of the village died but the plague did not spread to the surrounding area. Given that people did not know the source  of the plague merely that human contact passed it on this was a remarkable event.

And even if they are 'wrong' they still are designed to ameliorate the effects esp given that flu is extraordinarily good at mutating.

Wearable tech. Fitness trackers, smart watches etc all do blood pressure and heart rate - some even do body temperature as well.
There are many potential uses for the big data sets from these tools. I am not a clinician, butsurely there could be a number of correlations that could be drawn from some of this data,?
For example: If I am wearing one of these devices and:
1. I am feeling like I have a cold or flu, and I am walking up a gentle incline to my place of work, it seems harder work than usual - my heart rate increases as if I've been running, and perhaps my body temperature is also elevated (and has been for a day).
2. Because of the above, my heart rate is faster for a longer continuous period, far longer than any regular scheduled exercise fitness program.
3. Conversely, I am 'resting' and so there is no sign of any regular exercise regime occurring.

Without presenting a lot of mathematics it would be possible (e.g. by using graphs) to give a deeper insight in the method. This could help students to link these rather abstract articles with e.g. ""R"".

Fairly obviously it only includes data from people who use Google and therefore a precaution would be to try to confirm how representative the actions of Google users are in a particular problem area, before using them in nowcasting. Relatedly, Google data cannot be used to predict behaviours of people who for geographic, physical or cultural reasons do not use it. 

In this exercise, the motivation was to produce results quickly in order to base actions on them. The closer actions are to real time, the harder it is to override the results of the predictions being made. Another precaution therefore would be to ensure monitoring of the accuracy of the predictions, also in near real time, and set up a (negative) feedback loop into the analysis process. 

A deeper problem is the 'problem of induction' (which these methods share with science). The idea that observations of some phenomenon from the past can be taken as representative of all unobserved examples of that phenomenon past, present and future.

This makes me think whether the information queries on route planners could be used to give a better advise based on crowdedness. In my country there's only two planners widely used for public transport, and taking the data generated by these and using it to either add more trains or give people a less crowded travel option might result in a more pleasurable public transport trip. The hard part would indeed be to estimate how many percentage of people will be convinced to take the alternative option.

Perhaps it can be overcome by showing these people only the alternative option if the normal option is likely too be overcrowded, and then switching to a third alternative option if this one is also like to become overcrowded,etc? Both adding trains and changing routes can only be done until the limited is reached though, and let's not forget the limited number of hired & trained train drivers.

A similar technique of distributing traffic is already used in IT and is called load-balancing, but there you don't have the problem of estimating the human behaviour of following the alternative travel advise, as IT-systems are boringly predictable and just do what they're programmed.",2016-04-15 12:45:12 UTC,,1

It was only when the governments enforced strict controls and reporting that this was contained.  I wonder if as a response the enforced change if there will be a shift in the behaviour and therefore a cultural change too.   ",2016-04-16 00:45:21 UTC,,2

- How Google or other data providers process the data before making it available. 
- How often changes are made in the processing of data (are those changes occurring in the sample time). 
- How much influence from media and viral content (incites people to research terms) 
- Media related Search Influence will also be affected by age group and culture 
- Influenza viruses change due to antigenic drift and new strains emerge due to antigenic shift which causes big jumps bypassing herd immunity protection. So previous medical data should be modified to incorporate predicted rate of change in strains before use. 
- The level and effectiveness of immunisations in various areas of the study will influence both clinic attendance and searches (concern reduced in the immunised) so this also should be accounted for in the model. ",2016-04-16 04:37:58 UTC,,1

As already mentioned modes of travel and ability to move undetected between zones also cause major issues with predictability but once something like Ebola has happened we have good data for  predictions because the factors at play are unlikely to change in the near term.

I was reminded of a wonderful Ted-Talk by BJ Miller, a palliative care physician at Zen Hospice Project, and strangely, although the theme for his talk was 'What really matters at the end of life',  I think he got very close to how 'pure' and simple happiness (and joy) can be. It implies that true 'happiness' is closely linked to 'being at one' with things - something that is becoming extremely difficult in this 'always on', multi-tasking, consumerist society. 
It seems our life needs to be stripped back and laid bare, to force us to rewire our priorities, so we might learn again to experience true happiness.

Also, remembering the many stoics who present a brave face in adversity. External appearance can also be a mask covering true feelings. Ref - Pagliacci: vesti la giubba.

""One complication is the prevalence of illegal abortion before ’73. The Guttmacher Institute estimates between 700,000 and 800,000 women terminated their pregnancies each year in the decades preceding Roe. If large numbers of women prevented unwanted births prior to the ruling, the sudden availability of legal abortion might not have radically changed the overall number.
""Another thought: How does the theory scale across the globe? Crime rates rose and fell in other industrialized countries in tandem with the United States over the past 50 years. Did they see similar declines when they liberalized their abortion laws? Demonstrating its effect in lowering foreign crime rates would strengthen the argument for its role in the U.S. decline, too.""

With regard to enhanced border control, if we combine your ideas with some of those which came up in the crime topic, we get some interesting scenarios where human rights are concerned. Do you remember one case we looked at, where the police - having identified one area in which crime or civil unrest was likely to spike - set up controls on freedom of movement into and out of that area? This raises the question of where the borders will lie in an Internet of People and Things (IoPT). It's easy to imagine internal borders within nations being set up to limit the spread of disease. Easy, because there are plenty of historical examples, from the leper colonies of ancient and medieval times, to the controls set up to limit the outbreak of ebola within countries this century. As IoPT technologies proliferate (pro-life-rate?!), who's to say they'll be limited to predicting and controlling the spread of crime and disease?

Surely, the answer to the last question, ""Should the rules be different for scientists?"", was originally answered way back in the mists of time when academics in learned institutions decided that there would be two tracks - The Humanities, and The Sciences. 
Back then, when academia carried great weight with those who ruled and governed the land, wasn't it decided that the role of Science was to move forward and progress, to push things along with no great concern over morality or philosophical debate, because this was where the Humanities stepped in - to decide the moral and philosophical framework that Science could operate within. 
So, my long-winded reply is that yes, the rules are already different for scientists - BUT if Business & Commerce today is one of the 'arts' (or Humanities), then what kind of moral compass does that provide for the Sciences, especially when so often, Science relies upon Business & Commerce to feed it?

Predicting healthcare issues immediately springs to mind as beneficial to society as long that it is in societies interest (not, for instance, for insurers profiling their customers ;-). In my opinion we have to come to accept the inevitability of the fact that we all leave digital (persistent) trails behind and this either on-line through for instance our spending and social networking behavior and off-line through for instance the Internet of Things. Changing patterns in our on-line and off-line behavior may only be a minimalist limited duration means of protection against unwanted profiling. In my view the best protection would have to come from insisting upon regulation and for this regulation to insist upon transparency and liability for data sources and data analyzers for their actions i.e. for regulators to insist that if one engages in big data analysis one will be held liable for the consequences of ones analyses and the protection, release and disposition thereof.

The 'contagion' we are seeing is the spread of tweets/FB posts containing words linked to particular emotions, and there is an assumption that tweets reflect the mood of the tweeter. Is that a safe assumption I wonder? If I've just read a tweet about something bad happening, my next tweet is unlikely to be chirpy - but that doesn't necessarily mean that I would describe myself as being more miserable - unless the original tweet was bad news that affected me closely of course. I'm not sure that this is fundamentally different from the response we have to newspapers and TV where our mood changes as a result of the headline stories we read and see. In those cases the mood change can be deeper and longer lasting simply because of reinforcement by repetition over hours and days. ",2016-04-22 10:21:00 UTC,,1

If you own something of great value, be it a house. a valuable painting, cash, would you let it float around unguarded, unregulated, available to all to be used without you consent, looted, resold to others, etc...?

A lot of debit card transactions will even be processed by the same companies and nowadays for both a connection will be set up to check validity (credit card) or for a positive balance (debit card). The difference is mainly in the financial model, not in the way transactions are processed electronically.
 
Online debit cards are not very usual whereas credit card data (identifying personal data) will be stored in the administration by default, for future use. That is why I started to pay with my credit card using Paypal as a broker. My credit card is known at one single ""place"" reducing the risk of the data being stolen.

E.g. insurance companies are always trying to optimise their population. In the Netherlands everybody has to be accepted for a basic health insurance policy.

Offering insurance with only online access will reduce the number of elderly (less healthy) people. 
Another example is from some decades ago. Mail order companies started to exclude customers with zip-codes in areas causing too much trouble. Age was also a criterion. No Big Data around by then, but still a lot of harm was done by using a blunt instrument. 
Perhaps Big Data will even cause less collateral damage, because it is more precise. And for every abuse there will be a way to prevent or reduce it, using the same Big Data.

I use one type of 'big data' every day - the weather forecast, which relies on hundreds (thousands?) of automated observations and a sophisticated computer model.  It helps me choose what to do, and when, during the week and is a great bonus.

From GPS data on mobile devices (eg phones) it should be possible to draw a real-time map of movement-speed (ignoring those that are stationary eg at work).  This would be a 'now-cast' that would help in the same way as the weather.  Where movement-speed is high, the assumption is that traffic/transport is moving well and where the movement-speed is low the assumption is the reverse.  This would help people decide when to travel and when to stay put a bit longer.

One particular problem is who pays.  The weather forecast is paid-for by the Government, I assume, and maybe the movement-speed map I just mentioned could be also.  Do we, as a society, value new beneficial uses of big data highly enough to pay - or do we leave that to business, who may see no reason to do so, or who may want to turn things to their own advantage?",2016-04-23 14:29:57 UTC,,3

What are the symptoms? what you should do? what you should look out for? what you should avoid? etc. If the big data predictions did actually help shape government and business decisions for the better, and are properly communicated across society then I'm all for it. Especially when tax money is being put to use as a result. Yes drug companies would capitalise in these situations, that is the nature of business, but perhaps if everything is more transparent there is less opportunity for exploitation. So I think at the same time big data predictive models are put in place, regulation models & procedures should also be put in place so that society as a whole can benefit from the predictions and not just those trying to exploit situations for personal or business gain.

Already there is a question of what do we mean by society and can we separate out all the various parts of society and special interest groups, also are we considering short or long term objectives? I do not think answering the question in these broad terms is at all easy. I think we need to decide if we are taking a utilitarian approach or starting from the individual. I would start from the position that, as a general rule, anything that induces someone to act in a particular way, without their knowledge or (informed) consent, either for their benefit (and who decides) and especially if contrary to their immediate best interests, has to be scrutinised very carefully.

I think the question is: What should be permissible and what should not?
It does not matter if you are a scientist, a government, a commercial firm or an individual.

In relation to experiments, my intuition is that general principle of informed consent is a good one.
But I am not sure what kind of informed consent I would consider acceptable for the Facebook ""experiment"".
I suspect most of us accept Terms & Conditions when we sign up for web based services without reading them. Would that be good enough in this case?

In relation to politics and commerce, we are clearly being measured and controlled and we need to be.

If I am a government I can't really make any decisions unless I have some information and I certainly do not want to allow everyone to do what ever they like. 

If I am a commercial organisation similarly I need information on which to base decision and want to make people give me money. But that is OK, isn't it?

In principle the better the information I have the better the decisions I can make.

To me the question seems to be: 
What kind of measurement and control is acceptable and what is not?

If we can decide on this do we have any way to enforcing it?",2016-04-25 07:16:01 UTC,,2

For larger disasters you quickly run into the stupidity of the crowd, which has nothing to do with its individual members' intelligence, but purely with the fact it is a crowd. Crowds behave differently from individuals. If one sheep leaps over the fence and gets on the dangerous public road, more a likely to follow. Not because sheep are particularly stupid, but because a crowd loves to move 'as one'. That's how otherwise perfectly rational people participate in riots. So if a building collapsed and several people are running around panicked, it is incredibly difficult for any individual not to panic as well. With small disasters that at most contain several individuals, people can be more easily managed. ""Go sit down, it will be alright."" It takes quite a while to get a crowd moving, while individuals are thinking: ""I would love to comply, but I simply can't, there are too many people in the way.""

We also used maps and train times to see how long it would take us to get to the next location.
There were thousands of others doing the same.
One thing we didn't calculate was the effect the cold he had developed two days before the event would slow his progress on the last 5k.

I experienced an magnitude 7.2 earthquake in 2001, and experienced the panic amongst the indigenous population as they headed for high ground in anticipation of a tsunami that was never predicted. Whilst this was a rather under developed pacific nation where mobile phones were scarce, I imagine fast communication to a population could coordinate an evacuation and efficiently manage/monitor the movement of a large number of people in real time.

I guess a problem arises when those people do not do as they are advised.

I do remember reading about the use of mobile phones as seismometers to crowdsource far more data than would be possible by traditional methods. This might give a far more detailed picture of the intensity of an event at a very small scale and better inform emergency services where greater amounts of ground movement occurred.

It was all about testing the principle and devoping models, I think. So a set of 152 phones will do. If the models shows a sufficient fit, the real Big Data will come in and the model can evolve.

I wonder if we will see, over time, services to pop up to allow individuals to do very sophisticated big data analysis on demand, without having to learn how to use R etc. These services would probably be half open source/free and half commercial.

Leaving that aside, I guess it's not so surprising that text messages and tweets can be used to estimate crowds. I wonder though how accurate that would be in a real emergency? Taking the football crowd as an example, some spectators  will not have phones, of those who do some will never think of using them, some will use them every 10 minutes.

I don't think that knowing where large numbers of people are is actually the most important thing in disasters - that's usually pretty obvious.

Taking some examples: the Banda Aceh tsunami killed 1/4 of a million people, the Japanese tsunami 10s of thousands, 9/11 3,000. In 1996 the IRA set off a 1.5 tonne bomb in the centre of Manchester, the authorities had 90 minutes to evacuate the city centre: chain stores, offices, high-rise residential buildings, entertainment establishments - everything. They did it and cordoned off a 1 mile circle around the bomb as well. There were injuries but not a single death. The difference, I'd say, wasn't knowing where people were, it was that crucial 90 minutes warning and having emergency plans in place, and well trained - and yes, brave - people who did their jobs very well.

Storage capacity - water levels in a lot of the world's lakes have gone down considerably ie Lake Mead in the US - how much spare capacity is there?
Could desalination on a big enough scale be the answer to stop sea levels rising and to provide water where it is needed - oil pipelines built in very challenging conditions show it is possible if the incentive is there.

I think most people, are beginning to understand the trade-off they have to make between personal privacy and convenience to use online services. It is a transaction of value that you can choose to pay, or not.
In my view, the Facebook study shocked many people because they were not merely using the free-flow of data emanating from people's posts and replies with each other to observe human behaviour, and from that, draw some conclusions. Instead, they deliberately 'restricted the flow of data between senders and receivers to put either more emphasis on 'happy' or 'unhappy' messages and posts, to see whether that sentiment affected (infected) the network.
I understand it was in the name of science, but the public understanding of the usual type of data use is that it is more passive (data gathering), but on the other hand,what Facebook did was seen as an active experiment (data manipulation), and acting upon people -  to see if changing message sentiment affected mood",2016-04-29 03:30:10 UTC,,6

As for major disasters, in the 'post-event' phase, it will be vital for rescue services to know how many people may be trapped in a particular location. As most people in our country now carry a mobile / smartphone with them at all times, the GPS capabilities of that are invaluable - if the emergency services were given emergency powers and in the event of a major tragedy (earthquake?) be able to to 'over-ride' and activate Apple's 'find my phone' service, and any other similar Android apps to help locate trapped people.
- in our own country, whenever we've had a reasonable sized quake, the telco operators ask that people use social media instead of overwhelming the mobile networks as voice traffic can overwhelm the system - so again, after the event, and probably initiated by the user and their own family and friends, social media can provide a valuable comms trail.

We seem to be so mistrustful of politicians that we doubt that they will use the big data put before them to best use. While not defending the politicians I do wonder how many of them have read the BiS briefing note and probably more importantly, have understood it. We have all been involved in a 9 week course that has barely scratched the surface of what big data is capable of and yet we expect our elected representatives to speed read a briefing note and be fully informed. Maybe as the collection and interpretation of big data grows then the policy makers will be of a generation that accepts technology as part of their lives rather than something 'new' to get their heads around. The issue of commercial lobbyists is a big worry but maybe BiS could use the expertise and skills of the relevant academics to educate/advise/inform not only our political masters but the wider population, perhaps starting with school pupils, so that this potentially very important resource is recognised as such.

In Australia, there are many drivers that are not confident doing a hook turn when tram lines exist. It is often found that people are willing to do 3 left turns to make up for such a right turn.  Speed humps, speed humps, poorly timed traffic lights, and school zones are other great reasons for trying an alternative route.  And maybe its not about the shortest distance, but maybe the most economical ride.  Stop and start in heavy traffic uses loads of petrol and strains the car greatly.

But I think you've missed the point. Oyster is TfL's own card and it has a significant overhead to it.

I had experience with that ""help"" line when a second Oyster card failed; it had the first cracked when I trod on them and the cards stopped working. Each was replaced with new cards and I reset the auto top up details. Until the moment when I cancelled the debit/credit card associated with the cards. I couild not delete that payment card from my account details!

There is a huge difference between analysing data and manipulating it.

I am in no doubt, though I would be interested to hear any arguments to the contrary, that wilfully manipulating data, sent in any format, in any of the following ways is generally not desirable:
- Sent data is blocked
- Sent data is redacted or has something removed from it
- Sent data is altered in part or wholly
- Sent data has some content added to it
- Data is delivered and presented as originating from some origin that is was not sent from

I say ""generally"" not desirable because there are obvious exceptions.
We do sometimes want to legitimately block content as for example when a parent uses parental controls in relation to their child's internet access. But notice how in this case that while it could be the service provider who actually does the blocking, whether or not it happens is in theory in the control of the customer.

In my opinion, the manipulation of data in the ways listed above, should be a criminal offence for an internet provider or other services like face book.

Unfortunately it is probably not viable to agree and implement such law.",2016-05-02 18:42:55 UTC,,0

With devolution, in the UK at least, I think it is likely to be local councils who would find big data most useful, but unlikely to have the budgets to pay for the data and analysis.

I was interested that they thought that sharing of data was a feature of big data - I would think that would be one of the most useful things of all, though for me it's not big data - just sensible use of any data.

Poor decisions stem from either misunderstanding a situation, leading to incorrect action, or with understanding, an inappropriate action is chosen. 
Whist 'big data' could aid situational understanding, that understanding is constructed by thought  because it is not inherent in 'data'. The process is subject to human bias.
Using Big Data does not automatically invoke a correct choice.

More data is not necessarily better data; data preparation and depiction are similarly subject to bias, selectivity and framing, which could change awareness.
We might create Black Swans.
Smoothing data - search for a bump ( Higgs boson), could hide an unrelated but interesting dip. 
We could hide 'Dragon Kings'.

""Third, the Addison Lee drivers are provided with a satellite navigation device within their vehicle, adding uncertainty around the method by which routes are planned. However, the devices installed in the Addison Lee vehicles lack real-time traffic information and were not integrated within the job allocation process at the time of the study (e.g. routes were not automatically provided to the drivers), potentially reducing their utility. Nevertheless, efforts should be undertaken to establish how widely these devices were used.

And large data sets, able to provide us with a lot of information, have been around for a long time too - long before Big Data.

- Simulation can be very useful in detecting stupid ideas (or just errors on details) before implementing them. Most policy makers and managers do not like simulation, is my experience. Pilots could serve as a kind of real life, small-scale simulations, but even pilots are skipped in most cases. 
- Data Mining used to be very expensive. Distributed computing power is another development making it easier and cheaper. And on top of this, we don't have to be too careful using big data, because cross-examination and adjusting of output has become easier. So a quick sloppy approach can be repeated a couple of times, to see whether a pattern holds or not.

Secondly, we need to keep the right to privacy in mind all the time while collecting, processing and sharing the big data. There are huge risks.

While google search results will n ot be anecdotal because it commands a hugh share of global search operation, it does not control 100% thus some form of methods still needs to be employed for precise predictions. 
On another issue, most countries like the UK do have useful/ health medical website like the NHS website in the UK. You can access this site without google search.

Clarification or delineation between these requires additional knowledge. What and how have humans learnt to progress from Pagan beliefs of the Sun's causation, towards today's scientific understanding.

Stories could represent belief without question. Science, belief based on questioning and repeatability. Thus how might we identify appropriate questioning of big data so to generate understanding and new knowledge. What process will enable improved understanding and what is 'it' which we should learn?

About your example: how can you be sure the sun's rise is not causing the cockerel's crowing? There is a complex circadian, hormon-driven  rhythm in place and I wouldn't declare this to be ""only a correlation"" without any causality!

Apart from this, a lot of (para)scientist tend to declare something non-existant if there is no evidence yet. We could consider pagan beliefs to be hypotheses, to be confirmed or falsified - those ideas aren´t better or worse than a lot of other hypotheses.

@Guus, I agree.
Pagans; did they question their belief or consider a hypothesis.
So who questioned and formed an alternative hypothesis; how, when, and why.

How might we move on from massed data and correlations to a useful 'hypothesis'. Some, most data is unrepeatable, e.g. mass gatherings; other data requires context.
Traffic volume above the road's design capacity in Rio would warrant action, but in the UK, motorways might exceed their design capacity, but with 'smart' lanes and variable speed limits, would not warrant action (using the same definition).

An airline recorded touchdown position of their aircraft at all airports. 
Touchdown nearer the start of the runway vs the length of runway could represent the safety margin.
There was a good correlation on short runways, but less so on long ones. There were also different correlations at particular long-runway airports, longer and shorter touchdown distances, and some changed with direction of landing.
It was established that touchdown was proportionate to the location of the terminal and thus taxi distance.
Moral of the story; switch off the computer and get out of the office to establish context.

Big data offers a way of better targeting public spending - by showing what actions would have most effect at least cost (healthcare, transport, environment).  Data collection and targeting of resources is not new, but the granularity (and low cost) possible from big data makes new advances possible.  This then has the potential to reduce/maintain taxation and still come up with the goods that the Government (of any hue) no doubt promised - and, to be fair, probably wants to see in place.

But big data also offers new ways of measuring impact, both in actual outcomes and in public opinion, and this latter aspect (esp through social media) can give immediate feedback about what is popular and what is not.

However, the 'what' doesn't always answer the 'why', and so 'Big Data' practitioners should never purely operate in their own silos - e.g. human behaviour 'is', but we are also extremely adaptive, so just because we all behave in a certain way under certain stimuli, it doesn't mean that's our preference, it may just be to adapt to a particular problem or issue.
To get the best out of these data opportunities, there is a need for multi-disciplined teams to tackle key challenges. 
As for 'smart cities', I'm all for it, but again, privacy raises its head - can we be assured that all of these truly 'big data' dynamic feeds are being anonymised?

However, there are a number of ways that big data could possibly benefit us (and our metro-based counterparts) - what if 'rural communities' were themselves key datasets used as comparisons to the easier to acquire, population dense city sets? Think about health - are we actually healthier ? Less pollution, less traffic noise, more exercise? Do we sleep better than our city dwelling counterparts? Is our chance of surviving trauma or a major heart attack less than in the city due to our isolation? What about contact with fertilisers and spores in the country. Has the cutting of core community infrastructural services created additional pressures, are rates of rural depression, on a per capita basis lower or higher than in the city?
Talking from a New Zealand perspective, while the reduction of core infrastructure, amenities and rural health services, were done to cut costs, have they really? What if these changes have increased the ongoing social and economic costs to the country?

And, as you imply, the power is with the suppliers, not the consumers. 

There's a similar, probably bigger, issue with the Finance sector. Banks and building societies offer a plethora of different savings accounts with different teaser rates, penalties, terms and so on. Needless to say the most attractive-looking and heavily marketed accounts are the ones that benefit the bank most - not the customer.

I love that our Ashesi University graduates can perform sophisticated numerical analysis without the high cost of SAS or SPSS. Thanks for the link, Chanuki, it makes these points well. I do find myself using 'R' more than I would have thought -- the ""merge"" was a stunning example of how compact R's syntax can be. Also, the ability to document how you arrived at your results and to replicate them easily on new datasets makes this ""old-fashioned"" CLI style language preferable to a GUI interface where it is more difficult to automate or document the steps.

Agree with other reviewers who congratulated you on the courage to attempt a ""dive"" into an admittedly complicated program in such a general, introductory class. We are finding our students can learn about programming while they are learning about statistics, and R is our language of choice across the quantitative curriculum.",2016-05-20 15:58:57 UTC,,1

My trouble is I'm a top-down learner, so I would have liked to understand the R grammar first (at least a little bit) before using it. I recognised e.g. the case-sensitivity I know from UNIX, but it wasn't mentioned I think. It also wasn´t clear to me whether the variables obeyed naming conventions or just reflected personal preferences. So it felt like I was jumping through hoops.

After @Stephan told me R was related to Python, I started to look at this language and recognised a lot of LISP-like features - even better. This helped me to understand R better, so probably I will go on using it in the future now I have a clearer view of what's underneath. 

After all I am taking courses on Big Data because - especially for somebody like me, dealing with data all my career - a new attitude and way of working and thinking has to be developed for it.",2016-05-20 23:03:24 UTC,,0

It took this idea a step further by having clients that are coping with mental illness work with their clinicians to program a treatment plan into an online profile.  When responding to daily prompts on their smartphone, the app would receive the user's input on how they were feeling, and then respond with a message of encouragement or means to cope with how they were feeling (e.g., client tells the program their feeling sad, program looks up what makes the client feel better and responds with something like 'go to yoga').  if that type of information could be made available on a 'big data' scale, i think we'd be able to produce some pretty interesting findings :)",2016-05-21 16:29:04 UTC,,1
