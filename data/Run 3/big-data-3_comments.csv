Google hid search data at a user level for websites receiving visits from its search engine a few years ago (https://googleblog.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/making-search-more-secure.html) making it more difficult to tie your specific query with you as a person, although there was much contention in the marketing world about their true motivations for this. That said, pre-2011 if you had searched for ""jobs in tech"", ended up on a website competing with your employer, filled out a form with your name and submitted it, the competitor could have tied your query to your name via the form submission by tracking your path through its website via analytics.

One major criticism of anti-doping / cheating in general is that the moderating agencies always ""one step behind"" the cheaters (this is always said in the context of professional sports doping, but it applies in different ways when looking at amateur cheating as well).

On an amateur level, a lot of cheating / doping goes on on an individual basis, without the help of doctors or networks. A lot of people use the Internet to research both cheating methods like course cutting and drug use. Potentially, the ways in which people search for or talk about cheating methods could be used to predict the rise of new methods, sources and discussions. This way, agencies and events are able to see new trends while they are on the rise, rather than having to wait until after they catch significant numbers of people (which usually doesn't happen on an amateur level due to funding restrictions).",2017-05-22 10:40:35 UTC,12,,,,

In 2017 in particular we have seen the usual opinion pollsters in various countries, especially the UK and the USA, make the wrong predictions of election outcomes.  The Brexit outcome in the UK, and the election of Donald Trump in the USA are two examples.  I’m sure there are more.  Let’s for the moment put aside the various suggestions on *why* the voters behaved the way they did.
Supposing one could analyse Google data on searches for various candidates (people or parties) in the months leading up to an election or referendum, would it show anything useful?  Would it help predict outcomes more accurately than the usual opinion polls?
I suppose that the people doing the searching would have a greater inclination to vote than those who can’t be bothered to search, or to vote. Is that good from a prediction point of view? I would guess yes, in comparison with the typically 1,000 people in an opinion poll, who answered the questions because they had been asked them, but who possibly didn’t all vote on the day, despite what they said to the pollster.

The 'big data' emerges as a leading tool for designing social policies

Data is the basis of decision making. Without them, it is not possible to know how many people live in poverty, how many schools are to be built and where, or to what public funds are allocated and with what result. However, to date, more than a hundred countries do not register well something as basic as births and deaths.
The big data is the ocean of digital data that people in both industrialized and developing countries generate in their daily lives: when they use mobile phones, they transfer money, they search for information on the Internet or they connect to social networks,...",2017-05-23 13:04:40 UTC,3,,,,

It's like collecting all your searching queries, putting them all together and then creating a customised searching profile, so every time you are looking for something, all the relevant information you may need is there. So, this can enable Google to gradually built a panel market based on individual's behaviours, hobbies, trends, habits, beliefs etc. making small groups of segments with similar interests and searching profiles. That will give the opportunity to companies and manufacturers to track significant combined consumer information and offer an integrated selling package to them. That will led to a very different selling process through synergies, as the future is much more focused on selling a fully customer experience than a single product or service.

Somewhat related I just read an interesting article written by an attorney who is now warning persons who are having or had their DNA tested through over-the-counter products to be sure to read the disclosures. He asserts that one popular DNA testing corporation becomes the owner of your DNA results and can use it for any purpose it deems fits. It was revealed the corporation has one of the largest amassed databases for DNA results that is made available to a host of non-related entities. ",2017-05-24 20:34:12 UTC,2,,,,

What was also interesting, was looking at the interest by region (worldwide) for each search term, as Kricket had a search interest of 100 in Greece. Having looked up the translation for cricket in Greek, it is κρίκετ, which phonetically is spelt as Kriket.

Also, the two hypotheses they bring up are possible explanations for their findings. These hypotheses are in need to be tested by another experiment in order to see what the causes of the underlying correlation are.

By the way: one very important reason why the sentence ""correlation does not equal causation"" is meaningful is that scientists are interested in the underlying causes. There could be other things correlated with, in this case, future/past search behavior that are theoretically more meaningful to cause a high GDP (or vice versa).

For example, I looked at the amount of searches for 2011 and 2013, in 2012. On the first glance it did not exactly look like the pattern that was described here in one of the videos.
For that sake, why didn't the authors, as a robustness check, look at all the years where there was data on searches from the previous and next year and then see whether the patterns where stable or whether they changed.
For example, when I looked, the USA where more past oriented, even though they have a high GDP.

That's a good question. 

First, The key here is cummulative data, not being based on only one data point of one particular person. That's why the size of the sample is quite important, to annulate all the variance in results that could occur accidentally (or that could be depended on only one person). So, although you probably search for different things every other second (different from the previous) when million other humans are searching the same word as you in some moment of time, we can then compare the features that are surrounding those persons.

No person is that much unique and patterns occur all the time :) 

And on the other side, many human traits remain the same throughout the lifespan and different cultures so that gives a good base for doing such research :) ",2017-05-26 09:09:06 UTC,6,,,,

Sure you could search for correlations between optimist/pessimist classification and internet search but then you would have to know which ""data points"" are pessimistic and which are optimistic, no?

Regarding your question Simon about some causation proofs I actually have a very interesting example of small research, I did a couple of weeks ago. So, when I saw this study and the linkage between future searches and economic growth I was quite positively surprised :)

So, I did a really small research just for fun using Google Trends and was searching for the word ""kid"" or ""child"" across different countries. 
The link on my study is here: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/mo%C5%BEe-li-guglanje-otkriti-standard-zemalja-i-druge-google-ivana-begi%C4%87 
Unfortunately, the text is in Croatian, but maybe the ""almighty"" Google will help :)

SO, it happens that parents from countries with lower economic standards (lower GDP) tend to search more often for medical conditions, medicine and such when it comes to children. On the other hand, parents from a more well-off country, don't use Google search for looking for children health issues but rather look for entertainment topics, games, digital apps, shopping items and eCommerce sites.

This is meant in a sense that those who are being observed do not know they are being observed (at least in the most ideal scenario) and that the researcher does not make any manipulation of the situation where peope are being observed. The second aspect is the crucial one. Analyzing data from questionnaires or the big data example here about the google searches are examples. 
The ""active"" type of data omes from experiments, where subjects most often (but not necessarily) know they are participating in an experiment and where the researcher actively manipulates the context of the behavior in order to make inferences on the influence of such manipulations.

Can you think of decisions which businesses or policy makers might need to make which would benefit from improved estimates of collective future behaviour?

Policy instruments are “concrete and specified operational forms of intervention by
public authorities” (Bemelmans-Videc, 1998, p. 4), envisioned to attain explicit goals through
organising the relationship amongst individuals and the government. Bestowing to Hood (1983), policy
instruments are “predominantly a way of controlling society” and are integral to the continued
existence of government. Policy instruments are tied to the “nature of the state” where differing administrations of governance will select different instruments to improve the same or comparable social problems (Howlett, 1991). 

Within different administrations of governance some policy instruments will enjoy greater rightfulness than others (Howlett, 2005). Cultural norms, ideology and public opinion encouragement which footnotes the types of tools measured as legitimate (Salamon, 2002b).

While policy instruments can be focused at collections such as homegrown administrations or foreign governments, we must quintessence the importance of social policy instruments projected to influence the behaviour of individuals, which in the aggregate will affect a group and thus civilisation as a whole. The persistence of policy instruments is to change individual behaviour in agreement with some social or governmental goal (Bobrow & Dryzek, 1987; Leeuw, 1998; Schneider & Ingram, 1990).

Cheap cuts of meat contain more fat.  Higher grade meat that has less fat and is more expensive.  The better the quality of meat the more expensive it is.  It isn't merely a question of motivation.

BUT there might be a lot of reasons for doing a search on our chosen term which have no connection to the behaviour we are hoping to nowcast or forecast.  Similarly there may be varying rates of people undertaking the activity without doing the web search.  And as we have seen before, looking across national and linguistic boundaries can be difficult.

I would like to make you aware of a similar discussion in economics/psychology/law/politics. The concept of influencing human behavior by means of 'nudging'. A 'nudge' is a way to influence behavior without forbidding anything, and without any payments. See this picture for a good classification: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C6Ewp55WMAAaaO8.jpg
There is a similar discussion around this topic: What if governments start using nudges in order to make people do things that are bad for themselves, even if this would mean that the intervention cannot be a nudge by definition? Are companies doing this via marketing for decades already? Who decides what is good and bad for a person (after all, spending something for the right things is not bad).

If we start with suicide it's important to realise that the reporting of suicide is variable per country and affected by culture. 'Cluster' suicides are the minority. There are helpful resources online such as the National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide by People with Mental Illness. Data are also available from the Office of National Statistics. Google searches may be helpful in identifying searches for techniques but unlikely to identify causes in a meaningful way.

I am unclear what you mean by 'infections might have impacts on mental health'. Infections such as influenza or CMV can cause depression. Sepsis causes delirium and encaphalitides can cause psychosis (including autoimmune variants). Equally syphilis was a major cause of psychosis as a result of tertiary neurosyphilis causing general paresis of the insane (GPI). They don't tend to cluster so even if there were searches the chance that this would be meaningful clinically is low.

Dreams could be harnessed from our minds, such a far-reach from the future but possible. The data of dreams may be recorded to identify the sub-consciousness, thus, it could summon reality since academics have made quite the breakthrough. Subjects within approved test sites have been hooked up to electroencephalography (EEG) machines, the subjects then to fall asleep within an fMRI machine. Scientists used the EEG interpretations to categorise when the subjects began to enter a dreaming phase. The subjects were then at the appointed time woken up and asked to remembrance what they were dreaming about. This process was repeated nearly 200 times for each subject. Later, the scientists crunched this data and revealed that certain mutual categories of objects from the subjects' dreams could be associated with brain patterns as recorded by the fMRI scans.

It states:
Each data point is divided by the total searches of the geography and time range it represents, to compare relative popularity. Otherwise places with the most search volume would always be ranked highest.

The resulting numbers are then scaled on a range of 0 to 100 based on a topic’s proportion to all searches on all topics.

Different regions that show the same number of searches for a term will not always have the same total search volumes.

So, what we conventionally understand as a best guess falls short of what science does, i.e. providing methods and tools in order to strive to make the best possible guesses, also striving to be as devoid as possible of any biases that are common to human cognition and therefore inferences. As I said in another post, humans (unintentionally) tend to see patterns where there are none, are prone to rationalize patterns after observing data (hindsight-bias), interpret data in a way that supports their initial hypothesis (confirmation bias), and many many more.

Third, although the aim of the paper is not to explain, but to predict, it would profit from a more solid theoretical grounding of why the researchers expect search behavior to rpedict actual occurrences in order to not be lead astray by spurious correlation.

One could argue that this study suggests that more forward looking nations are potentially more optimistic in their view of the world.

Thus, could growth in the index preface a growth in consumer optimism, and therefore a growth in spending (i.e. GDP/capita)? and should this be one of many measures monitored to observe potential future changes in consumption habits?

There are also other ways to get such data, for example by using R to download the HTML code of the website having the data, searching through it and then extracting what you need (which needs knowledge of JSON). You can even open a website with R and program how to navigate the website (package: Reselenium).

(1) The spike in UK-based Google searches regarding Brexit the day *after* the EU referendum result. I think data and social science researchers should be looking into data sets that delineate the 'how' and the 'timing of how' electorates engage with the information they need to make democratic, informed decisions. Researchers concerned with political balance and accountability should encourage people to consume information up-stream of big, decisive votes and draw attention to data bias and omissions in a timely way.

(2) The use of data trends to map out health phenomena, such as the local spreading of flu and other viruses.

The market is constantly changing its behavior so your strategies for swing trades and position trades should be evolving constantly.

This has important implications: People react systematically to certain things. Take economics: It is a fairly reasonable statement to say that, if prices increase, demand will decrease (all other things being equal). Behavior is predictable, not meaning that this predicts the future behavior of every single person. Some might decrease their demand by a large amount, some might even increase their demand (for whatever reason), some people might just do nothing. However, and this is somehow what prediction in a statistical sense means: When increasing the price, we would, based on the data we have, expect that, on average, people decrease their demand. On average here means something like: If we bet several times on the likely reaction to the price increase of several people, we would gain more money on the long run, then if we would just guess randomly.

In the real world we have to look for data that can accurately proxy changes in these expectations and emotions.

Once downloaded, either click in the box next to it in Packages or type library(swirl) in the console, once loaded, type swirl in the Console, then follow the instructions.

Be aware however that this hypothesis grounds on the assumption of perfect rationality (a common one in (neo-classical) economics), i.e. that people behave rationally, have unlimited cognitive capacity and memory, etc. However, there is also eveidence that this is not the case and people rather behave boundedly rational (Richard Thaler did research on this in combination with the efficient market hypothesis).

It has recently become popular in economics as standard measures used to assess the state of an economy, e.g., gross domestic product (GDP), are only determined after a long delay, and are even then subject to subsequent revisions. Nowcasting models have been applied in many institutions, in particular, Central Banks, and the technique is used routinely to monitor the state of the economy in real time.""",2017-06-06 20:27:27 UTC,1,,,,

There is no difference in the models. ... Prediction is the use of sample regression function to estimate a value for the dependent variable conditioned on some unobserved values of the independent variable.
Prediction is simply saying something about the future. Predictions are usually focussed on outcomes and not the pathway to those outcomes. For example, I could predict that by 2050 all vehicles will be powered by electric motors without explaining how we get from low adoption in 2011 to full adoption by 2050. As you can see from the previous example, predictions are not necessarily based on data. source:

Like a few people have posted, I made the mistake of missing the library(RCurl) first time, but managed to spot that quickly. Interesting that that's a common mistake, yet it's all there in front of us.... 
Not entirely sure what R does that python can't, but hope that will make sense as the course progresses.
Question.. when you use the ' gets '   symbol,  <-   , is that a static copy of the source at that time, or is it refreshed..
eg if we use 
rawData <- getURL(""http://stats.grok.se/json/en/201410/Friday"")

anytime we reference rawData, does it go and fetch it again, or is it as captured on declaration.

Similary, when we set up the parsed version, is that copy at that time, or does it fetch and re-parse.

Sociologist Herbert Blumer (1969) mentions the four types he distinguished are casual crowds, conventional crowds, expressive crowds, and acting crowds. A fifth type, protest crowds, has also been distinguished by supplementary academics. A casual crowd is a gathering of people who happen to be in the same place at the same time. The people in this category of crowd have no real common pledge, long-term purpose, or identity. A specimen of a casual crowd is a congregation of people who are waiting to cross the street at a busy juncture in a large city. True, they are all waiting to cross the street and to this degree do have a common goal, but this goal is momentary and this specific assortment of people hurriedly evaporates once this goal is accomplished. Signals that construct measuring human behaviour can be hard to explain, however, the environment may allow behaviourists preordain connections in-between the physical location and the crowd by such conventional norms for behaviour itself e.g. Football stadiums, nightclubs and parks which encapsulate a casual crowd.

Sociologist Ralf Turner has gone beyond insufficient psychological clarification of the crowd’s behaviour and industrialized an up-and-coming norm standpoint. The central thesis of this viewpoint is that even in the most violent and hazardous crowds, there is also social communication, in which a situation is well-defined, norms for authorizing behaviour development, and shapes of actions are justified and agreed upon. Consequently, all above clarifications throw light on either one or the other factor of the multifaceted spectacle of crowd behaviour. As such, they are incomplete and insufficient. There is a manifold of such influences, such as anonymity, stimulation, emotionality, suggestibility, initiation, contagion, lack of volition, force of unconscious impulses, etc., which are accountable for the development of the characteristic behaviour of the crowd. Weather forecasting is rather generic when identifying certain movements in calendar seasons depending on which part of the world an individual dwells, for example I live within The United Kingdom that forecasts gloom and doom atmospheric conditions.

There clearly is much more data available than was previously, and it is now becoming a challenge in itself to just process all of it - in terms of its size, never mind its format. This is why it's exciting for areas like high performance computing to come up with new ways to process this data. This is also why it's interesting for all other domains to have access to the results of this processing.
Structured and unstructured data only refers to the format in which the data comes.

Structured data is, by its nature, easier to process by the machines. So that's what we're trying to obtain. But, in reality, a lot of our data comes in unstructured form - and then you need machine learning and natural language processing and other means of extracting the structure from that data, before you can actually use it for any statistics or predictions.

Finally, context is a totally different thing - it can refer to where the data comes from (the original or source context) or where the data is used (the target or output context). ",2017-06-08 09:27:38 UTC,1,,,,

I put all of the commands and workings into that file and I save that before I exit R.  For this I am using wk1, wk2 etc.  At the end of the week I might go through and tidy it up so that it can run without bugs.  Sometimes I delete some of the tries I have made, and sometimes I comment them out (##)  so I can see the logic path I had and where I went wrong or what optional ways there are to do things.
When you close R will ask if you want to save the workspace, I never do that as it can get cluttered up and sometimes corrupted, so closing R withot saving clears out all of the debris. If you have left some files you have been working on open it will ask if you want to save them, if you want to keep that work, leave them checked.

We might have the necessary accurate data to make weather forecasts but we miss the knowledge to predict what humans may do in the future. That might relies on the fact that human behaviour is basically controlled by the brain, our data processing system. When we talk about mind control we must take into consideration and the concept that the human mind can be altered or controlled by certain psychological techniques. That means that when humans underlie coercive persuasion lose the ability to think critically or independently, allow the introduction of new, unwanted thoughts and ideas, and change their attitudes, values, and beliefs. So, maybe the only way to start acquiring knowledge and experience on human behaviour is to understand how it is affected by external factors.

There, we rely on a very abstract model of human behavior, i.e. the homo oeconomicus or economic man. This has been argued to be a very simplistic and almost 'wrong' assumption underlying human behavior, but has been said to work reasonably enough. This is famously stated the very influential economist Milton Friedman in his Essays in Positive Economics that it is not important if humans really act as if they were fully rational, but rather that it is important wheather humans act ""as if"" they were fully rational. I see it that there is always a trade off between realistic assumptions and the complexity of a theory or model.

Briefly, If the criminal writes the name of someone in the death note, that person will die by heart attack. To search for the person holding the death note, L collected the time when the victims died and arranged them into a calendar. This turned out to be similar to a timetable for high school students. This means that the criminal could only use the death note when he was out of school time. Using this approach, the identity of the criminal was narrowed into students.

The reason a 100 year likelihood of flood continues to be argued as a reason for not protecting against that flood by the Environment Agency, is that even if that flood happens every year from 2011 on, data from the past 100 years on which the prediction is based says it will only happen once! Some meteorologists are arguing that if we go back 300 or 500 years, before records were kept, but based on proxies like sedimentary deposits, we can get better predictions, as floods were more common before 20th c in UK. However, I would expect that longer term weather predictions now need to combine climate change factors with past records. Likewise with human behaviour and technology.

Down Jones includes data of 30 companies   such as Bank of America, Citigroup Coca Cola, etc. and is added data of Travellers too. 
The results suggest that interest of news of a company is related to the interest in stock markets of the corresponding company as well as change in transaction volume is linked to change in stock prices. More than half of the correlation coefficients are significantly different than zero.
They expanded the study by checking the relationship between transaction volume three days before the news and three days after the news and the result one day before the news is very related to the news the same day as it was already discussed.

I think Big Data can be used as an additional tool to identify crime hot spots as well as what is leading to those crime but the tool should be used with care. Poor educational achievement leading to low paid dead end jobs or no jobs, family problems leading to low motivation and achievements or getting involved with groups of people who don't seem to realise all the consequences of committing crime.
Various forms of crime are results of complex set of problems and as you say requires various agencies to be involved.
It is important to have quality data for Big data tools. With most people carrying mobile phones it is possible to collect locations data and people they contacted, perhaps involved in some criminal activity but this does necessarily correlate to criminal activity.
There is no substitute for community policing to build trust with local community, have intelligence that can foresee upcoming events that may require additional resources. There is of course additional cost attached to community policing.  ",2017-06-13 17:45:02 UTC,0,,,,

Technically, I doubt there will be data for current month, or if they are, they will be only for days up to today, so it can skew our datas seriously, as suddenly for current month there will be far fewer searches, than for months before.

Good point about the current month, that one is better to be left out indeed, changed the code to "">="" to reflect this. Looking at the data it produces the brackets are not needed, it works as expected.

And yeah, skipping dates with no data would be more efficient indeed. Right now it collects ALL months in the range (even when there is no data) and afterwords removes the months that are missing and/or that have no data. The result should be the same I think, but your solution is more elegant.

So, how sure we are about an event that it keeps appearing not because of its nature but because of personal reasons, needs, intentions and feelings? A baby cries because it’s hungry, ill, in pain, or needs to be cleaned up. I imagine that predicting the possibilities and the frequency of crying, we have to know the reasons that create it, their frequency and their intensity and then make a model that calculates and predicts baby’s tears. For me its sounds something like this, when we speak about predicting crimes. Not have taken into consideration the kind of the crime (robbery, murder, rape, kidnapping), and the facts that show the criminal’s intention we’re approaching the incident as a physical phenomenon.

On the contrary, if the search volume in week t is lower than in previous weeks, this is a positive sign, to buy the index back with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the professors keep this position for exactly one week. And then they sell, to make profit. Otherwise, they lose.

First crime rates are defined at least as much by social conditions as by individual decisions made opportunistically. I've worked with the police in a public health role on a few occasions and they are interested in social data as well as crime data. Prevention and policing need broader views of relevant data. Second, crime patterns are dynamic: predictive models based on data about past events may not keep up with changes on the ground, especially those changes that result from action taken on past data. Third, ethics: there is much concern on the use of big data to target areas and people: the idea that algorithms produce value free data is a problem.

So, it wouldn't be a good time to try and rob someone.

It was the biggest fire in that country and it killed more than sixty people! How could the Portuguese authorities save these lives? I know this beautiful country. Many of your righways and roads have tolls. So if we consider the flow of cars for 24 hours, seven days a week, using toll data, maybe they can predict how many cars would be located in the area of violent fires and order the toll company to close the passages. Probably, it would keep part of sixty victimis away from the risk. The other resource for working this strategy may be installing fire sensors around roads and highways. When they sent fire messages, the toll stations would lock the passages. It's just a simple idea. But it could save many lives.",2017-06-19 00:21:09 UTC,2,,,,

The problem is that the data is emotionless and ""ethicless"" i.e. it is based on facts so if the data points to a specific area or population with higher crime rates, is the question around ethics aimed at enforcement or more toward an understanding of causation?

Why did someone decide to search that particular movie on that particular search engine in the first place? If the movie was a sequel there is a clear motivating factor but if it's a new non-sequel movie then clearly some form of marketing has motivated the search. Perhaps a similar trend can be found on social media as an event gets closer and it becomes more of a talking point, it could even increase it's viral capacity in the immediate aftermath as well. The main issue with basing predictions on this data would be how effective would this search be if the marketing and publicity was minimal. Would the same results occur?

Any piece of data exists because someone has decided that it should - we collect data on specific things for specific purposes and those motivations have ethical and political dimensions. From these choices can grow very substantial knowledge structures into which prejudices can be built, like design flaws in a building. In your example of an area or population with a higher crime rate - what is the definition of an area? A postcode? An LSOA? A local authority area? A policing command unit? All of these choices are both based on data and produce data and each will have its own assumptions built in, which may lead to the selection of a population that is more or less ethnically homogenous, or skewed older or younger. As you say - there's considerable debate about these issues; I think you either have to say that we must work hard to eradicate these biases OR we must accept that political and ethical choices are inherent and acknowledge that. I favour the latter.",2017-06-20 05:20:02 UTC,3,,,,

I see beauty and grandeur in the brutalism of some industrial buildings, some that the Victorians built are truly awe inspiring.

My sentiment is that Data is simply numbers, it has no emotional feeling and SHOULD simply state the facts that the data implies. Data cannot have ethics however the interpretation and resulting activities will depend on the ethics and moral compass of the ""enforcers"", be they political or security. 

The ""area"" has to be geographical and time-stamped, two very clear constants in the data analysis. These will be defined by the ""enforcers"", this may be physical borders, an apartment block or a street corner. If, based on the cold facts, crime is high at a specific street corner, deploying police to that location is not an ethical decision its simply common sense. Should this not be the case no matter where the location is? It is the actions where ethics and empathy (the use of human common sense) that will help the ""enforcers"" to make the correct decision.

Authorities can use classification of behaviour and disease models to deliberate and comprehend the consequences of human behavioural responses to diseases, it is useful to distinguish that there are two different methods at play. Human behaviour is grounded on attitudes, belief systems, opinions and awareness of a disease, and all these influences can modify over time, equally in an individual and in the population on the unabridged. The undercurrents in these attributes conducts one component that is germane to understanding the impact of behavioural rejoinders to a virus. On the other hand, the spread of the pathogen generates a second system, as delineated above in the explanation of the SIR model.

Seems that for some reason your script is not creating the AllViewsData object.
I suggest you close RStudio, don't save the workspace.
!. Run the script from week 4 to create allURLs
2. Copy and paste the script to create AllViewsData and run it
3. Look in the Environment quadrant to see if the object has been created.
If not go through that script line by line to see if you can see where the problem occurs. Place your cusor on the line you want to execute then press ctrl and enter at the same time.  For the loop you will need to put your cursor on the first line within the loop cat(
and work down from there.  Let me know what error messages you get.

Sorry I didn't read your post correctly.  404 is telling you that the URL does not exist, so there is likely to be something wrong with their generation.
Still suggest that you follow the process above.  Go back to week4.  Recopy and re-run the generation of allURLs to make sure you are getting the correct addresses.",2017-06-30 08:46:10 UTC,0,,,,

People adapt with changes, at one time they are willing to accept information available on Google search. I think people are more likely to cross check information or go directly to pharmacy or general practitioner if the symptoms are quite unusual or persist over time.
Search on Google may include people trying to discount symptoms (and health problem) they have before booking an appointment with general practitioner.
So to correlate Google search for flu related subject needs to take data form other sources as well, sale of flu related over the counter medication, number of days taken off work in a certain time period etc. ",2017-06-30 10:47:10 UTC,1,,,,

In my view, which is obvious from my last response, observing my behaviour and then reporting on it for Scientific Research, ideas that could be misconstrued based on my behaviour is unethical unless I was informed that this was occurring. That is I have directly given consent or even indirectly given consent, by continuing with my social interchange knowing that the information was being used for Research.

Doing so without my knowing and then me later finding out that this was occurring could in fact ""do harm"" to my peace of mind, my ability to trust others or to trust the ""system,"" and could alter my behaviour negatively - so that I start behaving in an uncharacteristic manner once realising that this had occurred.

The National Security Agency has rejected privacy laws for established software like PRISM collecting mass data that somehow fights ""enemies of the state"" or is that just what they want you to think, henceforward, it seems the NSA collects more data on the public than who supposedly comes under the list of ""enemies of the state"" outside the limits of international law and order tapping into phone, laptop or ipad data encrypted by broken down firewalls and mathematical information.

Big data to manipulate people to buy certain products already exists but some of the research already covered in this week demonstrates the potential for this to go much further and be much more insidiuos - as Anthony has already mentioned there is some evidence of use of big data to plan targeted attempts at voter manipulation in recent elections and that will probably get more sophisticated over time, but also one could imagine the use of the idea of 'emotion contagion' through targeted use of information from big data to try to influence populations whether by the state or by anti- or non-state organisations.

My sense of the scenic is based on having grown up in rural countryside, so even city parks may strike me as distinctly urban.

Perhaps it is worthwhile to keep in mind the ultimate objective of why we do such influenza research in a more removed sense and this will prove why this 'combined dataset' approach is valuable, even though the traditional measures are available with a lag of only one week. With influenzas, you are always looking for the next pandemic i.e. an outbreak where numbers shoot through the roof - medical practitioners will tell you we are long overdue such a pandemic. Perfecting this combined dataset will be valuable in allowing us to detect, project and allocate resources when the next pandemic hits, if it does. The real-time Google aspect of the dataset will be key in unlocking new symptoms that inhere in a new influenza outbreak and allowing us to chart the severity of it.

Combining historical datasets with internet data and making conservative estimates with internet data are good ways to control for the fact that not every instance of flu-related data online translates into one sick person with flu. You could also try to set baselines, though I would need further research about making them robust enough! For example, sampling multiple online datasets over smaller timeframes and then aggregating them; or looking for what could be taken as a 'mean year' or 'mean week' or 'mean month' - frames in which there was no media hysteria driving online behaviour upwards- could be good ways to build 'frames' to hang new data on.

When pandemics have traditionally happened, a lot of the harm comes from sorting out the logistics, partnerships, allocations and communications, which often delays a proper response and means a lot of people suffer or are worried in the meantime. This is also what people tend to be most critical of: the chaos, the lack of a response, the feeling that, for a while, no one in charge knows what they are doing. With time to prepare, not only can the right sort of resources be stockpiled (drugs, equipment, ambulances) but moreover, health nodes can be coordinated into effective networks. They can set up the communications systems for feeding information to each other (i.e. number of beds available, drugs that are running critically low, approaches that are being effective) and they can also prepare the public with timely communications, too. For example, advice on when they will be safe on home, and when they might need to travel to a hospital, procedures on what to do if a hospital is fully-occupied and so on.

In addition to what you've said, scientific research studies released by several universities or research institutions, and that later appear in the news may also impact the behavior of the stock market in terms of supply and demand, as you mentioned before. For instance, days ago I read in the news that drinking three cups of coffee (can't remember if the cups were supposed to be small , haha) a day may actually improve people's health. This type of information could influence the change of tastes and preferences (a determinant of demand), and therefore, the change in behavioral patterns, which in turn could impact the behavior of stocks of companies that produce coffee and its derivatives. These companies (like Nestlè or Starbucks, don't know if the latter operates in the stock market, but I mention it here anyway) could see the value of their stocks increase, due to a higher demand of the products they sell since it provides benefits for human health.

However cities have become congested, groups of people within cities can become disenfranchised  (elderly, younger people without work). These are social problems. Similarly amenities problems of planning for transport, housing, educational establishments etc. Big data can help plan for this.
I have come across people whose daily journey to work is 100 miles (single trip). There are cases where it is 200 miles. Do these people need to be in office everyday, can they be in the office few days a month only, do they need a permanent desk in the office? Can transport facility be better organised so that worker from 30-50 miles from home to place of work can travel easily? Some of these questions require collaboration between different groups of people to come to options available eventual decision. Most if not all would benefit with tool such Big Data analytic.

Big data and smart cities may predict such interconnected problems by instrumenting risk signals or chaos theory within its branch of mathematics that can display future events just by a click of a button. Indeed, human behaviour can encapsulate fractals that can see expanding symmetry or evolving symmetry; this can simulate and rationally identify occurring matters which can quantum leap the action before applied by homo sapiens around the metropolitan environment; In mathematical physics this can also mechanise the theory of Lebesgue covering dimension or topological dimension of a topological space which can use a set of points alongside its counterparts between metric space that list an ordered pair. Anomalies within this method of time and space within the 3rd dimension hold something called a Cartesian product that breaks down the order of time and space inside mechanical mathematics. asymmetric errors inside this dimension can identify future events that can breakdown societies equilibrium by splinter infiltration of this mathematical theory called the butterfly effect.

Particularly platforms like instagram are built on the idea of the 'curated' life wherein the lived experience may be very different, painful, sad and lonely. Social media can lead us to lie, prevaricate, edit our lives because honesty seems a degree removed and we are less answerable. I am sceptical whether Facebook happiness marries up to lived happiness.

I think it could certainly be applied to the inauguration of President Trump, which was very controversial in the media for 'claims versus reality'. However, the Trump inauguration dimension does point to the key dilemma of media, data and audience capture: if Trump claims to have the biggest audience of all time, then this becomes a 'virtual, online reality' as social media, commentators and broadcasters melt down over the issue. The internet debate looms over the physical reality and people will remember Trump's inauguration perhaps more than others for its online controversary, even if other inaugurations do in fact garner the bigger crowd. This points to the trend of global leaders increasingly having to capture the online conversation in order to control the debate as, no matter how many people turn up, it will never match the number of non-attendees, non-aligned voters and people who are inactive in politics. The internet lets us be present without being actually being present and this trend is fuelling the 'fake news' debate and the dilemma of being able to manufacture reality through online information curation.

This is one potential pitfall and there is a very big caveat of having to consider big data in relational to circumstantial or contextual evidence.

And the definition of fastest and shortest does not depend on geography alone, but on the traffic condition, the driver's knowledge of the streets as well as the ever changing conditions of the roads, weather, time of the day etc.

Taking the situation to the extreme, the only way one could get a 100% of all vehicles to use the one same route, is that the city has only just one road, no side street, alley etc. Everyone is forced to use the one route.

Thus, I think it is only logical that the study found, at maximum, only 40% or so drivers  used the so call shortest route. Even assuming that it is peak hour and the traffic is rather congested, an experienced driver will try to avoid the heavy traffic by taking alternative routes.

I think this data is also useful in evidencing drivers' decisions- they are not all just trying to take a long route to bump up the metre, but rather have an intuition of how the city works that could be useful in wider urban navigation.

One is the use of predictive analytics as applied to crime data, and I've secured the services of Dr Tom Kirchmaier from the LSE to talk about the work he is doing for the Home Office in this area. Being able to predict crime 'hotspots' will no doubt help in prioritising police resources and -
 one would hope - lead to safer city environments. However, I'm hoping we can explore some of the deeper issues, such as insurance companies using this data to penalise householders. The other theme I want to explore, which has not really surfaced in this course, is what degree of trust we can have in the underlying algorithms used in big data analytics. Juan Mateo-Garcia has an interesting paper on this topic ( http://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/err-algorithm-algorithmic-fallibility-and-economic-organisation), and has agreed to speak at the workshop I've mentioned.

Maybe I haven't understood well what the Google searches are: an aggregated number of people searching for Lisbon, for instance, on a set time? But the search is carried out by one person (or 2, 3, 4) together in one point in time. And they might or not go all of them to Lisbon.

I understand that the size of domains put at disadvantage the search data but it's illustrative on how to best chose the predictive tool. Another problem is illustrated by the fact that when people search for a movie released, normally they are looking for tickets or theaters and it's highly probable that they purchase tickets. But with the music domain, lots of people look for lyrics, videos, etc of particular artist but don't buy the music. So good for the authors of the paper to acknowledge these limitations of data search. My feeling at the moment is that one has to choose very carefully the subject to predict. For instance, how many people will land at Heathrow airport in August 2017? Here search data might be useful since mostly people search for flights with intention to take them.

One example of this is the patterns of bombing during the blitz in London which appeared to indicate targeting of particular areas but in practice weren't. This could lead to people trying to identify and rationalise patterns which don't really exist and therefore could lead to a narrative being created which decides how resources are allocated when the narrative doesn't exist. This would be irrespective of the fact there is a strong correlation recorded. The other factor which is difficult to allow for in this is that the use of street networks is essentially rational but burglars, for example, don't use the city in a rational way. They adopt a different approach to what is and isn't possible in terms of traversing the city therefore it could be a risky basis on which to base resource allocation. Thinking like a burglar would likely come up with a different means by which you navigate the city which could undermine the betweenness analysis.

As a starting point it causes you to wonder things like, the more comfortable your economic situation is, the more room you have to think of your future.  If your economic situation is fraught you are more likely to be focussed on your immediate circumstances, as opposed to what might happen next year or those coming after.

Cities can have information about where do local people spend their money, their wallet split, where the best neighbors inside their area to build new houses are or how they can optimize their road network.

I did wonder if this was because in the UK, traditionally men give flowers, chocolates, jewellery and underwear to women.  However there isn't the same kind of obvious choice for women to give to men.  Perhaps rather than this data showing that less men buy presents for girlfriends (obviously we're making the big assumption of heteronormative relationships here!) it instead shows that men do not have to think about the present as it is obvious but women are less sure what to buy and need online advice.

city and then there's data about the people. The people, of course, are the most interesting part. They're why the city exists. They build the city. The city is for them and we'd like to know many things about them.

not, and it is a composite index, divided in different dimensions: income, employment, health, education, housing, living environment, crime. You can clearly see that there are certain dimensions that are more important, they are more related to
recognisability than other dimensions. So for the first time, you can not only talk about abstract well-being, but you know which dimension of well-being, as percentages, are related to the recognisability. ",2017-08-14 16:53:20 UTC,0,,,,
