For example; (1) The conscious mind that when asked a question thinks it over to come to a conclusion. (2) The part of the mind that thinks over what the the conscious is thinking wondering if that sounds something reasonable to say in that situation according to your personality, and (3) The part of the mind that is thinking about other unrelated things such as, ""do I look good today?"", ""why are they looking at me like that?"", ""what will I do after this event?"", the part that is assessing the environment. I think there are also more levels to this ""theory"" that I have. After watching this video I am curious how this can relate and fit into the concept of the flat-mind. ",2015-11-09 00:33:38 UTC,,2

Children the very old or the mentally ill are not always free to invent their own story? Sometimes a person's story is one created by others for them?
The surface is all there is? Does this mean you believe a person's actions are all we need consider becasue all else is pointless speculation?
 What is a person's story? Is it how they perceive themselves to be living [autobiography-which you warn is unreliable] or is it how others perceive their actions [biography-fraught with all the usual problems of bias, scant factual information and firnds who either recall them with rose coloured glasses or ennemies who see only the worst in them?]

Some thoughts - Surely our past experiences are drawn on each moment to interpret the present situation, and therefore influence it? It is reasonable that these responses are then encoded as memories too, and a composite picture gets built up over time, of responses to similar situations. The sum of these form our beliefs and values, which reflect our world view and our place in that perceived world.

Why don't we just admit, there is another ontologic dimension,  where the ""mind""  exists in reality. 

Avicenna (ibn Sina) & definitely Algazel (al-Ghazaly) simply but cogently start by DE-MYSTIFYING the human beings.

Human beings have body & soul, a position also adopted (paradigmatically) by Pre-Cartesian  Western scholars. 

What's wrong with asserting, the Soul exists as an Axiom, First Principles, Atomic Statement  or whatever, philosophers or epistemologists use of words.

There is certainly, a Theory of Human Faculty derived from the Reality of Soul, or Being, not that it is separate from  ""matter"".

In the material world of which the ""physical human being"" exists (as composing of atoms & Higgs bosons), the Soul is the CONSCIOUSNESS to seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting & sensing thru' the eyes, ears, nose, tongue & sensory.

The ""mind"" (or more correctly, the ""reasoning Soul"" ) is the faculty of reasoning of the Soul) where the Soul is an Ontologic Being or Reality (see al Ghazali).

The ""mind"" should not be ""reduced""  to its unnatural parts divorcing itself from the natural association , uncompromising ties to it  wholesome ""wholiness"" (holistic existence), technically, a living be-ing (reality).

Rumi laments about the reeds being cut off and separated from its origins (see -Song of the Reeds). 

Wouldn't  making FLAT what is naturally Dynamic may hide, even pains the ""Mind"" thud, doing great injustice to the poor Soul (reasoning Mind).

Mind you, in the ""mirror"" of the physical being, see what happens, when you attempt to (1) reduce the brain into individual parts  (2) flatten the brain by slicing into microscopic specimens (3) remove the brain from supply of oxygenated blood driven by the lung-heart system and keeping cool & warm by the pairs of kidneys and glands all over the body.

The mind indeed is mind-boggling, sometimes, mindless !

Basically, our decision making is all dependant on the focus of the question we're asked.

Where does Mind subsists & whence, it begins to exists;   again, reminds of the  ""Singularity""  that which triggers ""Big Bang"" and after very long duration in time &  space, we have Mind.

Lucy, who had a history of severe mental illness, told us she wanted to go to the bank to draw money for Christmas presents. Perhaps that was the real reason why she went to Aylesbury with her bank book. An hour later she was dead – having fallen from a multistory car park.  
Had she really had planned to go to the bank. Perhaps as she walked through the town she went to the car park because someone taunted her with the words “jailbird” – although the only reason she had been in prison was that the hospital failed to readmit one of their outpatients following a manic episode. Perhaps she realised it was an anniversary linked to her imprisonment, and became depressed that she might never get a job working with children again. And was the reason she chose the low rather than the high car park simply because she wanted (yet again) to self-harm and hadn’t realised the comparative small drop would be fatal.

I must agree that perception and presentation, either visual or written, is a key component to how we make decisions.

In our own lives, we dress a certain way to give a visual message about ourselves to others that, we hope, will give the perception we have chosen to them.  Media colours our perceptions of events constantly and often changes our perceptions of  events or people.

However, I still find it difficult to accept that 'behaviour is all we've got': surely, the same behaviours can originate for different reasons (e.g. 'helping someone' may be because of a moral belief that this is the right thing to do - or it might be to secure a friendship - or it might be done in the hope of pecuniary return at some point in the future).

Think of our mind as a sea of memories.

As the ripples collide they stir up other memories, but at the same time ripples fade with time, so that at any one time the maximum number of concepts we can think about is limited.

Nevertheless there are other situations. Very simple example, I need more money, but for getting well-paid position, I need to increase my qualification.

Many of the groups selling these securities were (then) perceived as well respected financial institutions such as banks. They had a reputation for honesty and integrity. 

A lot of investors had developed financial relationships with those institutions over many years. These relationships proved beneficial to both parties in that time.

When you trust someone you are generally more likely to accept what they say on face value without necessarily looking to deep into the issue not expecting them to lie to you. This is especially when they tell you what you want to hear ( the greed factor).

Your point on research is a good one however you need to be sure that the information does not all originate from the same source.

I agree human psychology is not as complex as it is portrayed. Behaviour is after all the result of the interpretation of some stimuli.

Very simple neural nets cannot handle negative concepts – basically because they can only remember what the sense organs actually sense – and for example you cannot see something that is NOT there – so a simple brain cannot directly remember the negative. If you scale things up I think you would get something like the behaviour described in the Video. Some memories are pleasant and some are distasteful. In some cases we are more prone to consider the pleasant and in other cases we consider the distasteful – but there is no formal NOT linkage relating one to the other so the result may not be logically rational.

I understand many people don't reflect and question their behaviour and emotions on a daily basis taking into account their own bias, but if you do, it is perfectly possible to deduce reasoning while accounting for biases. We are also gifted with memory, yes it comes with bias and can show gaps, but as long as you are aware of them and try to remain as objective as possible, you can ask me about my dinner experience and I will be able to tell you the food wasn't great, which was a shame because I had high hopes for the restaurant in question.

To propose a parallel experiment, if someone is asked to look at, say a carpet' and respond to the question, 'what colour is the carpet?', responses tend to be general in nature such as 'it's brown with a fleck pattern'.  If you then ask the person to 'look deeper', the degree of fine perception increases - people will say, for example, that 'the background is predominantly beige and the flecks are a mix of white and brown'.  And, indeed, I've found it possible to ask for greater concentration at the same distance whereby people have been able to distinguish even more fine features of textural colour (even patterns of carpet tufts).

First of all, I accept the use of positive attributes (without substantive consideration of negatives) when requested to think about what I'd rather do (what I'd call a 'wish list') combined with a degree of attitudinal positivism (Bali) - and I'd agree that a different set of criteria are used (triggered by terms like 'reject') to deselect Bali and choose Bournemouth.  As you suggest, the two tasks (select/deselect) trigger entirely different mental processes to be brought into play - and I think that there are academic studies which demonstrate this effect.
Secondly, with respect to the 'magic' experiments, I would suspect that the bulk of the  data comes from what I'd call 'floating voters' (i.e. you give me the choice between two beautiful girls or handsome men and, quite frankly, I'm not sure that I care sufficiently to be churlish if someone swaps the cards).

And the best part of it was that people did not realize it happening, they just made up stories for why they did it - or even better - they took the stories offered by the ones who influenced them.

Keep in mind you can train yourself (or life to train you) to ignore factors which once triggered you.

Another perspective on the levels - it is a concept (based on age of observations) from the ancient India (and later Buddhism):

All thoughts are just thoughts - no matter if they appear verbal, visual or in another form. Levels of thoughts are illusionary - they are just thoughts and are on the same level. The most ""deep"" level is being aware of your awareness.

What appears as levels of thinking are actually levels of concepts, but this can be an infinite regression - thinking about thinking about thinking about thinking about... which can be summarized as - thinking.

I may probably confuse you even more, but some masters of meditative practices (decades of practice) observed their thoughts and feelings for so long, that they realized the illusionary nature of them all - that a persons identity is contained only in his memories, and those memories constitute his thoughts.

Does it just apply to beliefs, decision making, perhaps actions to take in a crisis or life threatening situation ? I can not see it applying to stored memories of ""facts"" for example facts used to solve crosswords or quiz games, or mathematical problems, even Sudoku. Surely these memories are from depth ?

I can accept that during some activities decisions are constantly being made ""on the fly"", for example driving a car, but should anything unexpected happen, perhaps brake hard on a wet road and skid, you need knowledge from deep memory to force you to release the brake and steer into direction of skid momentarily. But here antilock braking systems have negated that level of thought so perhaps helping to FLATten more minds.

For example, company analysts rate companies and forecast their share earnings.  These are published, and available to the whole market. Once the actual results are in, you can see if the analysts were any good or not. 
Many analysts look at each other and think, well he said +1, she said +1, so I will say +1.  Collectively most analysts are saying +1. 
In a population of analysts most will say +1, but there will be outliers, who say +5 or perhaps -5 and these are the ones who are spot on, because they are better at their jobs; or who are way off,  because they are lousy at their jobs.

If you work out how accurate each analyst has been over time, (easy enough) it lends greater weight to an outlier, particularly if they are regularly better or worse than average. It doesn’t really matter if the outliers are consistently over or under estimating, you can profit either way.

I like the idea that “thinking about thinking about thinking about thinking about... which can be summarized as - thinking.”
I am currently working on some ideas that could make it possible to relate our thoughts to what is actually happening in the network of neurons that exist in the brain. A key idea is that any concept can be considered to be a collection of simpler concepts, and can also be part of a more complex concept.  One then has levels in the sense that some concepts are more complex than others, and when we are thinking we can move between these levels.
However all concepts, however complex, are “just concepts” and the brain processes all concepts in the same way irrespective of the levels.

This is all very subjective in that the modern way of thinking has moved from that of sensible people in the 70s for example.

The US however has always had crashes of the stock market.  In the financial world I ended up buying a book called The Barefoot Investor by Scott Pape, because the guy had seen how young people were looking after their money doing it the way others were doing it and he tried to put a sensible approach that works to it, a bit of the 1930s sensibility into it, I am making this up of course because my memory is not as good as some people's who make it their business to remember these details in a lot of ways, though that is not all of it.

The first was not to do anything that drew attention to yourself – but to get lost in the crowd. The second was to work hard at the school work to try and get the teachers on your side. To survive you had to be like a sheep and conform.
At thirteen I went to a progressive co-educational boarding school called Dartington Hall which had “no corporal punishment, indeed no punishment at all; no prefects; no uniforms;  no segregation of the sexes; no compulsory games, compulsory religion or compulsory anything else, no competition; no jingoism.”
It was a real eye-opened in that I suddenly realized that many things “everyone did” involved following arbitrary conventions. For instance there were two safety rules about using the outdoor swimming pool and that was it. There was no rule about what you wore and the problems of changing under a towel and what to do with wet bathing costumes vanished.
I learnt is that it is good for everyone  to spend some time thinking “outside the conventional box” rather than just conforming'

I find too often some people enjoy drama and feeling 'deep emotions', ie, sadness, because they believe this makes them more interesting/unique as if they have some depth of feeling which most people lack. To be even more controversial, I find the media (music industry especially), often encourage this self centredness. But this is unhealthy.

You and others have highlighted my bias and mistrust of the subconscious  improviser's decisions.  Thanks for the prompt \ discussion will make me more open minded in my quest to gain vulcan abilities.

We we say things like 'deep thinker' or 'depth of the mind' we usually mean that the mind can be original, creative, sublime, interactive, etc. Or as you say, the ability to react, remember, sense, interact. He isn't arguing against this--in fact, his model might be able to accommodate in more flexible ways than the typical model. 

The typical model of 'deep mind' that he is referring to is one which sees the mind as multi-layered. choices are the top layer, the only one visible to us. choices are informed by something 'deeper' (subconscious, values, etc). Some of psychology posits that behavior is to some degree a direct function of the deep places (I think), which is a rather deterministic picture of choice and behavior, if you ask me. 

His idea is rather that the things that we usually perceive as 'deep' or below choice, happen on the same level as choice, interacting in different ways.

We know 'love' exists, and can testify to it being experienced but it is not visible in its pure form, and can only be seen in its manifest form. The course seemingly presents the mind as a giant filing system or library, rather than a multifaceted, multi-functional, integrated, dynamic organism. The idea of 'confabulation', evident in youth whose brain is not fully developed, is akin to 'improvisation', but i think that what is being described as: 'making it up as we go along',  is actually the embodiment of the person`s life experience being immediately accessible, and that these are governed by social norms.

I question those targets and key performance indicators that I chase in the business world.
Are there 'different' ways to succeed and so different measures to chase.
eg. Don't target the time spent in call centre queue, target customer stress levels.
May lead to very different customer service solutions.

This area may just light my fire but do feel if you watch it and think of the some targets and objectives you chase and questions some of your reasons for rating experiences; it grabs your attention.
Eg. Why do you avoid the gym,  why do you buy the branded pain killers, why did you not like the fast food experience.

I do think it is very worthwhile to remember that marketing is not about reality, but about attempting to influence/control the perception of that reality. 
In some respects marketing is like literature - it is not real, it is a perception. Famously, literature/art holds a mirror up to reality and can make us think about both. At least when you are reading, you know you are reading. Marketing on the other hand often tries to pass unnoticed. That's a bit like drug-smuggling.

Sometimes it is only one person on one side and everyone else has the opposite opinion. The minority is correct.

So if it's our perceptions that cause us to feel good or not so, rather than objective reality, why bother working on the objective stuff, rather than on perceptions.

I believe our current physical, mental and emotional states greatly influence how we react to the same situation, should it be possible to recreate the same on different feeling days. If were are physically and mentally tired or emotionally stressed we are more likely to feel more irritated etc. Often though we cannot pinpoint exactly what the cause is of our irritation (if we're honest and if we are not inclined to blame it on something outside of ourselves). It very seldom is that particular thing (in this case the person staged to cause the irritation) that causes our irritation. More often than not it is number of built-up events or feelings that sits behind it. The 'not knowing' contributes even more to our feelings of irritation - that adage of ""there is something under my skin but I don't know what it is""
But, should someone say ""this is why you're feeling like this"" - it would immediately take the added stress of 'not knowing' out of the equation and make the situation more tolerable.

As to the segment on emotions, I agree that for lower level emotions, we do have difficulty assessing the emotions of ourselves or others - it's based on perception. However, for people who know well, we might also use our memory about their habits to help our current perception.

For ourselves, for stronger emotions, I don't think we need to ""infer"" or ""perceive"" how we're feeling. If we're angry or anxious or very saddened, we're ""deeply affected"", and these strong emotions often bring up deep memories of things such as past injustices, lost loved ones, or other strongly emotional events.

The TV show ""Lie To Me"", based on some good studies, people do show micro-expressions which betray their emotions. It's simply that most of us are not very good at reading these.

Regarding focus, we need to be able to focus from an evolutionary standpoint in order to properly judge what is going on right in front of us, i.e. if a predator in whatever shape or form is standing in front of us, we need to be able to focus on it to determine treat levels etc. Our peripheral vision is more limited, because from an evolutionary standpoint you only have to perceive changes in color there, besides transitions from light to dark and vice versa, since these changes will make you focus on them when needed. It is a survival mechanism. It could be argued actually seeing everything at once, focus all around, would not make much sense, because it would be highly inefficient for the human as an organism or collection of organisms, if you will, since it would require more energy and thus survival would be harder.

I had been doing some very unconventional computer research when a merger closed down the project and I was out of a job – but I could take the research to a university. 
But which one? All the vacancies were for people who could teach conventional main stream topics.  
Then two came along together – Reader in a brand new technological university with no real research record at a high salary – and Assistant Lecturer at Cambridge at a pretty miserable salary.   
With a wife, three children and a mortgage to support I accepted the Readership at the interview and cancelled the Cambridge interview. It was the obvious short term “improviser” solution.

Normally when we describe something as 'made up' we are saying that it is a work of imagination or perhaps a lie.  To say that we are 'making up' an answer to the question of what colour someone's hair is when we are actually deliberately looking to check the colour goes against the usual definition of 'making up'.,2015-11-10 23:15:42 UTC,,1

So far you are still arguing from an unproven proposition. I have yet to see any evidence the mind ""makes up"" stuff on the fly. Making a decision on the spot based on ideas, past experiences and states, does in no way, shape or form mean said ideas etc. are made up on the spot. There is such a thing called memory, which is a proven model. Yes of course memory is biased and can have gaps, but these can be accounted for without purely making stuff up.

The more complicated the event the more assumptions will be made to make a decision, this is also logical, since we are only capable of modelling so much in real-time in our head. These assumptions are, however, still rooted in reality and, if you are a good decision maker, they are not made up. The stock market is an excellent example of what happens when the majority isn't a good decision maker.

However when deciding whether or not to buy a car they would have, while having a kid is a far more impactful event than owning a car. The same for the accompanying insurance and tax questions. Of course, I don't think the decision to have a kid should be purely based on finances and the like, but in my opinion they should be factored in.

In the first case the unconscious brain has processed the signals to the eye and told the conscious part that it sees a “rabbit” while in the second case it passes on a description and leaves the conscious part to work out what it is. 

Such a subconscious pre-processing mechanism exists for all sensory inputs and I would suggest the boundary between the conscious and subconscious is a very fluid one, which changes dynamically with learning experience and the unusualness of what is sensed. I would also suggest the subconscious automatic recognition processes work in exactly the same shallow way as the conscious processes (but behind the scene).

Judges rule based on established and well-documented past precedents and are expected to prevent any personal biases and emotions from influencing and interfering with their decision. This is far removed from how people behave. Memories are neither well-documented nor unbiased, often they are painted in a way to suit an individual's current perspective.

e.g. Formal logic is A=A, B=B [using this we just keep replicating what has been before]
Dialectical logic says A can equal A, B can equal B, and A can equal B.  Also A can both equal B and not equal it at the same time [example: a molecule of water on the edge of 2 intersecting rivers is both river A, river B and both rivers at once; another example: a bud becomes a flower - that flower both is the bud [same matter] and it is not [different form].

The problem is that I monitor ebay auction adverts daily in case anything “really important” comes up. Almost every day I see at least one card which I think the seller has significantly undervalued and which, considered on its own, would be a useful addition to the web site. So my shallow mind puts in a low bid – and often I win the auction.
What my shallow mind fails to realise is that each new purchase is only of any real value to me if I actually use it on my web site. However there is already a queue of purchased cards so long that it could take me well beyond my 100th birthday to clear the queue - on the assumption that I never brought any more.",2015-11-11 08:29:40 UTC,,1

This is marketing and modern society which have taught us to behave like that. But now, marketing is so impregnated in our everyday life and habits that it has become part of human history. Which means, in my view that it is has become free will.Despite its true nature.Just like a totalitarian regime, marketing has managed to replace free will so it has become free will even if we believe sometimes that we are not influenced by any kind of propaganda.

My perception of the mind is that it is a memory bank of experiences which, as it builds up, helps the owner to make better, more informed decisions based on experience. 
I believe this actually means that the mind DOES have depth.  An older, more experienced mind has much more depth than a younger more naive mind. These layers of experience are what allows older more experienced people to, often, handle situations in a more considered and 'adult' fashion.  If this was not the case we would have teenagers running multi-national corporations and even heading up governments, surely not!

Improvising is, to me, a sign of immaturity and lack of experience.  I suggest we only improvise when we find ourselves 'out of our depth' and the norm is actually 'considered' opinion. The less educated and experienced you are the more you are likely to improvise.

On the contrary, the course suggests that all past experience and knowledge and beliefs don't impact much our decisions, they are made on the fly, thus flatness here is the synonym of creativity.

I am also skeptical and unsatisfied with terms used, and don't agree that all our personality is what is created on the fly, but the quoted argument seems to be a misunderstanding.
I think the problem (or the approach) in this course is that the host doesn't make reservations, speaks in general and only vaguely mentions, ""Of course, of course, you are not simple, you are creative because you are not determined by previous experiences, beliefs, etc, you are created on the fly"".

Everyone rushed to buy as many as possible. Turns out they were out of expiry date and they were certainly not suitable for selling, in my opinion. But people were buying and rationalizing: ""Anyway, expiry date has no importance in case of detergent tablets"". Everyone was buying and probably if someone hesitated, he would also thought: ""everyone is buying it, it must be ok. And they are so cheap!"". I didn't buy it, off course; otherwise I wouldn't think it's strange.

Because of these narratives we take different meanings from things: the words I read mean one thing to me (and something different another time I read them) - and different to the meanings others take from them.

The best example of this I know comes from an interview by Alan Yentob of David Hockney - around the time of his 'Bigger Picture' exhibition a few years ago.  At one point they are both looking at a scene, and Hockney explains that while the physical scene appears similar, the meanings that each of them takes from it (based on their knowledge, experience, associations, focus on different objects etc) is so different, that it is in fact a different scene for each of them.

Your point about the mind -brain difference is good. As far as I know the mind is a whole body phenomenon that is closely connected with brain activity, in that thought and cognition in general don't happen without brain activation (see Squire, L. R. (2013). Fundamental neuroscience (4th ed..). Amsterdam ; Boston: Elsevier/Academic Press). Mind is a psychological construct, whereas brain is biological. In part, the fields use different language and have different purposes. Brain science wants to know what happens biologically, while mind science wants to know about thinking, emotion, learning, and human relationships. There are crossover studies, such as the Mind, Brain, and Education field.
I don't believe the mind has no deep workings. Humans have ethical beliefs that seem to direct automatic decision making with considerable predictability in any one person.

As, in UK, have to vote for a bundle of policies provided in A political parties Manifesto, rather than being able to select and choose which policies to vote for I will never Tory. It may be a negative vote but the Conservative ideology of individualism v collectivism (I could expand upon these but will keep it simple) offends me. They are out for themselves and dismiss those less fortunate than themselves. This is being exemplified with the welfare cuts at present. Again, I will not expound upon this here, suffice to say, I am not making up a story , in the moment, but using a  set of guided principles, based on my view of superior ethics and morality that is collectivism, which see the rich paying more in taxes (progressive) because they can afford it, and provide services for the less well off, who cannot (regressive taxes). This is a mark of a civilised society were everyone has a piece of the cake. Not just the greedy 1%.

So I'd argue that you need both points of view to succeed. You need to manage your costs and be efficient in the production of 'intrinsic' value, but you also need marketing (of a certain sort) to communicate that value and create 'extrinsic' value (i.e. perceived value).

So in the call centre example, you could reduce people's stress or cut queue times, but neither will succeed on it's own - you need both. A totally stress free experience may not be commercially viable if you don't deliver value to the customer 'economically'.",2015-11-12 02:06:17 UTC,,1

I understand the gist of 'mind is flat' to be a shift towards Posthumanist thought.  It goes that Humanists tend to endow humans with fancy ideas about ourselves; a kind of philosophical self-ornamentation = an anthropocentric view on the world: i.e. 'man is made in the image of God', etc. 

We have lots of fancy ideas about ourselves, and to be fair, we are amazing.  But, critical analysis shows that we are not as deep as we tend to believe, because the way our mind works is ad hoc, impromptu, makeshift at all times, and therefore it is not as deep as we would like to believe. 

The 'mind is flat' could be said to be a Posthumanist idea, a de-ornamentation of human psychology.  Either this, or I haven't got what Nick Chater is on about, ""…the shocking shallowness of human psychology.""   :)

If this is what it is meant by the mind being flat then I'm ok with it so far, but I'm very interested to know why the human mind  desires chronology when thinking about itself (and therefore perceives itself to have some kind of core) and how human beings learn.  Stored learning must be lodged somewhere in the mind - we may be making some things up in the moment but much of our learning develops in the womb, in early childhood and continues throughout life. We are not re-learning everything in the moment so where is this intelligence kept if not stored in our own minds??!!

Then there is the limbic brain that takes care of our emotions and value judgements and then there is the neocortex that in part is responsible for abstract thought and other higher functions. Some say that us being scared for spiders is part of the brain that was already evolved before we were humans, flight reaction for danger.

I find the idea of self-constitution through narratives quite reasonable, constrained by the past and the interactions we have with others. The idea that we have a sense of ourselves that we continually update to make sense of what happens seems exactly right.  Memory seems to function in this way too, our selections and distortions serve our sense of self in the present and future more than as a record of a past self.  The fact that character is central here makes this less a flat account, it seems, than a dynamic account... that our minds and our sense of self is dynamically updating all the time seems right to me.  Nothing in this account discounts the influence of the past on the present.  In fact, on a dynamic account the past is still present in us, but not statically so.

There is a different concept that runs in tandem with this course and that is the 'selling' part of any discussion. Effectively engaging someone in conversation, establishing some form of rapport, and then influencing or leading them into an area where the sales person wants to sell, the inertia has been broken and it is more difficult to stop the impetus. So, you are more likely to improvise... people either are inclined towards something (for gain or reward or praise) or inclined against something (to avoid criticism or embarrassment or pain) for example.

If I know nothing about an enterprise (the stock market, making air conditioners), and I care, I will ask someone who does know about these things.  For that person there is far less improvisation than there would be if I relied on my own very limited understanding.  

That we fill in the gaps in our knowledge has been the concern of many philosophers, from Socrates to Arendt: we need to think critically rather than accept received ideas.  But sometimes we trust , hand over the thinking, to those who we think are thinking critically if that is their area of expertise.  A good air conditioner repairman will think critically about his solutions for a problem, as will a good financial adviser.

 We will improvise to the extent that what we come up with is not going to make an essential difference to our practices.  Why not make up a reason why we bought some  item?  But reasons for things that do affect us are treated more critically.    I would like to see some studies on how we explore our reasons for important choices.

Under this third option: The ""flat"" mind interprets and innovates based on a lens of experience, behavioral paradigms and intuition. The mind then renders or projects a reality (the hologram) that we experience as depth. This is somewhere between illusion and reality. 

I got this idea from combining ideas from: ""The Holographic Universe"" - Michael Talbot; the personal experience of dreaming; and the episode with the madeleine in ""In Search of Lost Time"" - Marcel Proust.

One thing that is clear to me is that we cannot arrive at a reliable conclusion to these questions by drawing on our personal experience. ""Do I think the mind is flat or deep?"" , ""What does my experience tell me?"". These questions (and answers) are misleading. Our personal experience is corrupted because our personal experience is part of any illusion.

You also become more in touch with reality, which can be a little shocking at first, you start to see yourself and the world differently. You learn that people are very emotional, reactive and delusional... with practice you become less that way.

There also seems to be two broad categories of approaching the world -- thinkers and feelers. Feelers may be ""flatter,"" more susceptible to the environment they are in while making decisions, recalling information, etc., while thinkers may rely more on their folders of historical information.

I needed a first exercise which did not give the ""know-alls"" a big advantage. So I set up a package ""designed for an 11 year old"" and the assessment was an essay as to how suitable the package was for such a child. It was easy to use and all of them thought they were brighter than eleven year olds - so were not going to be beaten by the system. I also monitored what happened to see which features of the package were tested by the students.

Where you talk of people being honest if they don't know an answer, it can provoke disbelief.  One is often expected to choose a side in a debate without knowledge of the facts and to refuse to do so is met with disbelief.

You can be in perfect physical health but if you do not have mental health then your physical health does not really matter that much. You can be poor or in a wheelchair and still be ok have quality of life if you have mental well-being. Mental well-being is the most important thing we can have.

How these are wired as they develop I suspect is  based on DNA driven chemical & biological rules and  external stimuli that arrive in our mind from  our senses.

Maybe the flat dimension being discussed is our personal ""experience"" and the depth dimension our ""intuition"". They both form the ""case law"" being discussed, but with different priorities.

Most of the time, when all is calm, we try to use our experience and our thoughts are the way we balance these,. However at  times our intuition takes over for example in an emergency when many people have been known to do extraordinary things outside of their experience to protect themselves or others ""without thinking"".

Also in pleasure/pain, I think it is more complex than just comparison.

The Article ""Algorithms aren't everything"" http://www.trapped-by-the-box.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/article-algorithms-arent-everything.html describes how the mad rush to make money in the development of computers side-lined other interesting research. The industry was (and still is) dominated by people who said the underlying theories MUST BE RIGHT - just look how much money we are all making.

This gives me cause for concern on the validity of the principles we are heading towards seem to be built on shaky foundations

Also, I don’t agree with the conclusion of the experiment. If I had been paid $1 to do a simple but repetitive task and offered $20 to get someone else to do it, I would be pleased.  I would tell a potential recruit what had happened to me and if they were interested in the same deal they should confirm it was available to them.

Even where we believe that a conclusion supports the main theory of ""a flat mind"" I can find none so far that does not have an alternative plausible explanation, and so to me is not-proven.

The examples are also biased toward certain conditions, such as requiring quick answers, and as such the conclusion can only be considered within those boundaries. He is also including some scientific sounding experimental results to add to authenticity.

A good example of what I mean is the Bali/Bournemouth question. Posed as 2 independent questions, the answers may appear confused. However in practise we would go though a thinking process e.g. I prefer Bali but  could only I actually go to Bournemouth after rejecting Bali for multiple reasons. Using a part answer as a result is not convincing.

Thus, so far, a flat mind MAY apply to some situations where a quick or unfocussed answer is given. Which may be sufficient if we are looking at specific subjects and mindsets, but is far from being proven, even as a non-deductive argument.

I cannot possibly imagine how small an atom is or how far away the nearest star is, or how long the earth has existed. We can write the answers in numbers but these are all based on arbitrary standards, such as the metre or the second.

Even at the human level it doesn't really matter how tall you are - but if you are likely to get into a fight what matters is whether your opponent is bigger and stronger than you.

If you think in evolutionary terms all our pre-civilization forebears needed to be able to do is compare things - and not to come up with precise measures. It fact they wouldn't even have needed to count accurately in numbers but just to make general comparisons such as this pile of apples is big enough to allow every member of my family back at the cave to have one.

The reason our children's education involves an emphasis on learning about numbers and measuring things is that such absolute qualitative measures do not come naturally.",2015-11-13 19:19:07 UTC,,11

Especially enjoyed the placebo/adrenaline experiment because sometimes going through life in general and maybe you are not having a good day exacerbated by some personal stress or worry, and then you encounter someone, and for some reason they either become extra annoying, but for that moment, you forget it might be due to the fact stress might cause natural adrenaline to increase, and you think it could just be that person which might cause you to overreact at that moment, then you realise in hindsight and you are possibly filled with regret. Speaking from personal experience here. I guess the key factor here is being fully aware in the present moment of the whole situation before and during and being able to take a step back before reacting before being impulsive.

My husband and I are keen dancers who have had many years of lessons but we rarely go out dancing so I love a chance to show off our skills. So we practiced some simple social dances. A previous family wedding had been great. We were on the floor all night. However the entertainment  for the one I did not enjoy was nothing but loud disco music to which the many teenagers present jumped up and down. The buffet was not served until 9.30 and we had had no meals that day so we were ravenous. I would say that I was disappointed and there were rational explanations for this. Soon I am going to a birthday celebration. I don't really like missing my usual Friday routine of a swim and a meal with my husband. Will I enjoy this evening out or not? I actually don't know.

It would be quite easy perhaps for the US government to measure happiness as their society rates things on a scale from ""Catastrophic"" to ""Awesome!"". Britons on the other hand tend to be far more muted and rate things on scale from ""Not good"" to ""Not bad"". 

Another comparative example is the language used by traffic accident investigators. Consider the likely response to these two questions: 

1. ""How fast was the car going when it slammed into the side of your vehicle?"" 

2. ""What speed would you say the other vehicle was travelling at?""

I'm beginning to think that every single thing we do causes our brains to search for some form of comparator and, if there is none, then it of course has to make it up.

Professor Nick, I'm almost convinced. However, I've previously learnt not to close the decision making door when considering new information so won't this time either.

Are we really richer as a society or has the gulf between global 'haves' and 'have nots' simply widened?

Even in the developed world we compare ourselves to our peers. I recently heard it expressed as the 'haves' and 'have yachts'.

(2)	Employers of highly skilled computer staff wanted systems that were easier to program. My approach “avoided” directly addressing that problem.
(3)	Artificial Intelligence researchers were looking for highly formal mathematical solutions, while my approach said “keep it very simple”.
(4)	Brain scientists were too busy dropping “telephone” based models and switching to “conventional computer based” models.

They look where they think the researcher wants them to when searching for the hidden object. They tried the same experiment moving the object without human intervention and they did not do this. The talk also suggests we have no real preferences at all!. Perhaps this is an age related thing but I find that at 59 I do know what I prefer although I do things for social reasons. I found myself reacting spontaneously when I went to the SSPCA to choose a new rabbit when my old one had died. I had read some profiles and intended to choose the one which had been there longest. I felt that was more ethical but I set eyes on Fluffy and had to have him instead, based on aspects of his physical appearance.  ",2015-11-14 11:42:30 UTC,,0

How are these differences accounted for?   Is there something else (a mind?) which affects how these impulses are translated into our daily lives?

No species will evolve a brain bigger than it can fill with knowledge in its lifetime, and the flat mind model seems appropriate for maximising a species' survival because it is quick and works ""correctly"" most of the time. 
Humans have found a way of passing knowledge from generation to generation so it is not all lost when the brain dies. In addition language provides a much more efficient way of learning compared with trial and error. So basically we process vast quantities of complex cultural knowledge (which is not flat) using the genetically inherited animal ""flat mind"" mechanisms - and this disparity causes the limitations of the human mind being described in this course.

In the past various hospitals found ways to juggle the figures so that they appeared to fall inside government targets. 
The same happens with the police. I am aware of a sad case where a woman was assaulted by a neighbour and went to the police for advice. If the police record too many assaults where there is no prosecution they will fail to meet government targets. So the visit of a very vulnerable woman was not even recorded.

I came to those conclusions mostly from doing a lot of meditation. When you become more aware of your thoughts, you can't help but become more humble, because you realize that you're not as wonderful as you thought you were... you become more aware of your mistakes, but you also become more forgiving. Because how can you blame others for mistakes you make yourself. I thought I was the type of person who is very aware of herself before beginning my practice, but now I realize I wasn't as aware as I thought...

Fortunately we're not our thoughts (according to Buddhism), otherwise we would all be horrible people. All nature cares about is getting our genes to the next generation, about our survival. This explains the selfishness...

1) This may be true until people have financial experience.  If people utilise risk prone financial management strategies, then certainly in an uncertain economic climate like the one we have been faced with over the last 7 years or so, then they will have suffered the consequences of this and many will have 'learned' to be more fiscally conservative.  E.g. I had my superannuation plan on a high return management plan, without realising this was also 'high risk'.  After I experienced a year when my superannuation actually went backwards and not forwards, I quickly changed my plan to 'cash' (based on interest rates), so even though I might miss out on possible higher returns, I won't lose money [the worst case scenario is there is 0 interest, not a negative return].

My brother and I had both predicted the crash, and had been encouraging my father to sell his mining shares (Which we didn't approve of in any case).  He didn't.  After the crash, and some of them returned a little of their value, we expected he would then decide to sell (logical to us), but instead he maintained the shares and DID NOTHING.  Both my brother and I couldn't believe it.  We realised it was because of my father's intense faith in the mining industry (he was a geologist before he retired), and the shares hold some sort of value to him beyond money and beyond logic.  Hence, this experience could show the course's theory to be validated with regards to some people/situations, but from my experience many people do logically and practically work out the best course of action in a given situation.

Firstly, the experiment participators all knew it was an experiment and that (theoretically) they could avoid the experiment at any time.  Presumably, they also knew they could afford to avoid the shocks. Of course, a genuine experiment utilising this method can't be produced currently in a funded research experiment due to ethics committees, but we do have data from before ethics was considered a component of social and psychological research (e.g. Milgram experiment)

Secondly, I don't think money is a good measure.  Money is abstract and relative by its very nature.  Money markets are constantly fluctuating, so the value of money one day might be quite high, and low the next.  $1 in Australia might buy a chocolate bar, whereas $1 in one particular ashram in India can buy a comfortable room with ensuite for the night.

Sustainability Goal:Reduce the parts per million of phosphorous and nitrogen in waters surrounding the Cottesloe reef that cause the Cladophora algal bloom.

Action Required: An extensive education campaign as to the detrimental effects of fertiliser use, and dumping chemicals in storm water drains, on the marine environment
monitoring of fertiliser use and chemical dumping by council workers, community volunteers and members of the public.

Same could happen when you're asked about your decisions - you're making so much of them every day that you probably won't remember every single one. Some of them are even made unconsiously. So perhaps you infer what you might have thought in that particular moment like you've infered what you had for breakfast some days ago.

One variable not mentioned but I suspect is important is concentration.  Some of my decisions are not thought through because they are less important than other things I am doing. However I have then made a conscious decision to make the buying decision by instinct rather than logic.

For me: Brain collects facts, Mind interprets them, selecting information from the Memory cupboards of the Brain which stand readily stocked with information on which to base choices/answers/decisions. For me there is depth to mind/mental/memory. While some of it is 'hidden' either by forgetfulness or mental illness, most of it is there to be used when needed.

There was generally another explanation for each of the examples, and saying that we normally ""make answers up"" is, I still believe,  incorrect.

After the video, I believe what Nick is proposing is that we do not remember previous answers to questions, or decisions, but that we have a process to review our memories and ""calculate"" a answer at that point in time. That is more logical from an evolutionary point of view as we are more likely to make better decisions, and so adapt to changing surroundings better, if we try and work out new answers based on the latest  information, rather than what we came up with previously, since when our experience may have changed.

Thus, as the Flat Mind was initially explained in week 1, I an sceptical and a ""1"". If I am interpreting the real intent as I gleaned from the video, I am a 7.  I believe it is rare that we make up an answer as he implies. We calculate a new answer based on experience and instinct, thus leading to the McGurk effect.

As Maslow believed, we all need our basic needs met, for survival and well-being and in many less affluent countries this is a struggle.

Happy to believe some of the demonstrable facts eg we only really see that small area that we focus on, and of course we change our minds or are influenced by the environment, and we can take (most?) choices by instinct but we do have individual and differing views and can take (some, significant, considered) decisions based on deep beliefs formed by years of experience.

If you think of the mind in two parts – a memory store and a decision processor - there is a model which explains why we tend to make superficial decisions and are bad at judging comparative values.
The capacity of an animal brain is limited to what it will need in a lifetime to help it survive, and in general the number of sensible options as to what the animal can will be limited – so it does not need a very sophisticated decision processor. There would be very little need for an animal to count or to to handle absolute comparisons.
By using language humans have succeeded in cramming very much more information into greatly enlarged brains, and our world is very more complex, so there is a vast increase in the number of options our mind needs to consider.
What would we expect if, when humans have evolved a very much larger memory, the simple animal decision processor failed to evolve fast enough to keep up with the increased memory capacity? We would get a “shallow” mind which will tend to select the first likely looking option, which cannot make absolute comparisons, and be bad at estimating numbers and risk levels.

Think of an old-fashioned gramophone record. You have a plastic disc with a spiral grove. The music is stored as variations in the walls of the groove and the music that is currently being reproduced is an amplification of the vibrations of the gramophone needle.

Right now, I think the ""flat mind"" is a badly photocopied sports car of an idea.

I did come in with the concern it would be too behaviourist(?)/Skinner-esque (which I find really limiting) but it does seem to have much more depth.

I've come across some of the fallacies and examples before from ""you are not so smart"" blog but not really thought of the mechanics behind it.

The improvisation aspect makes more sense from an evolutionary point of view (writing and time for considered evaluation are new inventions) and, I believe, is very much part of the ""factory settings"" of all of us. However, we all have the capacity for non materially derived contemplation and that, when engaged, influences what we are. It may only ever be a minor part of our total being but, iterated recursively over time, may have a profound effect.

This does not mean that people's minds are inherently flat, but rather that society encourages their thinking to be one dimensional.  

Another factor not looked at is personality types.  Have the researchers on this course investigated Myers Briggs (which has been used in HR for many years)?  Differences in thinking style/preferences can explain a lot about some of the themes of this week, and people definitely do not respond uniformly to external stimuli.  There are a small number of personality types that dominate, and these types are usually those that are less nuanced.

Pragmatists will have some views on these questions - and rationalise them in e.g. terms of the optimum allocation of scarce resources and the practicalities of acting within a sphere of influence rather than trying to solve everything all at once.  But what if everything is connected to everything else?

I suppose what I'm getting at is that whatever your answers to these (and other questions) it really comes down to differing world views - and the narratives and explanations that we bring forward from them.

Also, we have had a week of flatness, but no discussion of what a 'mind' is.

Interestingly one way to break it seems to be not to change the underlying physical reality (which is difficult, it's hard to get a job etc) but to artificially break the mental cycle (i.e. do something fun and force yourself to laugh). 

If you do this, you break the cycle and suddenly start looking at things differently - is my life really so bad? I could be starving on the street etc. Then you have enough capacity to do something like play sport or go out and do something further breaking down the cycle.

It has been argued that we cannot (and indeed should not) measure happiness, only our unhappiness, as we cannot be 100% sure of what we really want to make us truly happy, but we are very sure of what we do not want, as this would tend to make us very unhappy.

Once I know that I don't have to worry about paying too much money for schools & medication, that's the first step of content. However, having gotten used to this, one might take it for granted & need more to be happy. 
Emotionally, one has to feel loved. Socially, one has to have friends and not feel alone. Cognitively, one has to look after the need of the mind to know things and fulfill its hunger for knowledge, and this gives a person a sweet satisfaction.
Since happiness is a combination of many things which can never be achieved simultaneously, one can not claim to be absolutely happy. Being absolutely happy is only immediate.

You then use your experts to ferret out the values for the criteria (but you can’t let them ‘know’ the decision model or they will attempt to influence it!) This removes their personal bias (confirmation bias etc) from the decision, but still lets you deploy their expertise in the process.

In Europe we're currently seeing a surge in migration (let's separate the migrants from the refugees for a second as this is a separate issue).

Would they feel the same way if they had been less exposed to what Europe supposedly has to offer? I'm guessing not.

However, I don't think it's true that the people on the richer island feel happier because they compare themselves to those on the poorer island. Again, looking at western culture, the majority of people don't seem to compare their lives to those in poorer countries and feel happier because of it.

I'm only slightly slightly younger than your father - and I wouldn't have had a clue.  However, my experience is that, living in different environments, does influence units of measure in common use.  For example, measuring 'distance' for travel in London is more often expressed in terms of 'time' - particularly when driving (e.g. 20 minutes from Camden Town to Finchley if travelling after the rush hour).  In addition, continental Europeans in general seem to be comfortable to discuss 'square metres' when referring to the size of a property - and have a good understanding of what that means to terms of how 'big' the property is - while, most of the time, I need to discuss the number of floors/rooms  and use terms like 'good' size, 'average' and small in order to get very flaky understanding.",2015-11-16 12:46:42 UTC,,1

There are also a great deal of people with advance hindsight here. It is of great concern to me that those who are held up as being economic geniuses for predicting a crash are actually outliers who are often in the longer term more likely to make an error than the average person.

The other sad fact, certainly within the UK pensions market is that if an individual does not need to make a decision, they probably won't.

I live in South Africa, the country with the highest Gini coefficient in the world  ie difference between rich and  poor. So we cannot generalise to say a whole nation is happy or unhappy: if there are cadres (India, Japan, USA, UK eg) which can measure their happiness quotient by simply looking around nearby, then they will do so, with direct affect. People in the townships do not love people living in Constantia, or the politicians who have done very well out of the pork barrel/gravy train.

I say 'people in townships' because they are at the bottom of the heap. There is no question of 'being happier' for them. There is much more probably a question of 'being very angry and protesting violently to government about conditions in which we barely survive'. Relativity works both ways, in the interests of rich and poor, or whatever situation it is you are examining. 

One factor with a calming effect on happiness/unhappiness, may in part answer the final question in the video: 'Is there really any more to being happy than thinking you're happy?'

She cannot remember what happened the day before. But she doesn't shake his. He asks her why she doesn't shake it. She tells him: ""Can't a lady decide not to shake a gentleman's hand?"" She has made up a reason on the spot but, perhaps, the subconscious part of her brain remembered that the day before he didn't shake hers.

Viewed through this filter, it makes sense that, the more ""rungs of the ladder"" of material success you can see above you, the more likely you are to yearn to reach those higher rungs, leading to more unfulfilled desire, more suffering, i.e. less happiness. So, yes, I can see that measuring yourself against a ""poorer"" environment is likely to make you feel less unhappy (assuming your level of material well-being remains fixed) than measuring yourself against a wealthier environment.

We should not dwell too much on what the exact definition of ""happiness"" is, as the example would work just as well if we had asked another subjective question (e.g. ""How optimistic are you?""). The point is that in the absence of an objective measure (e.g. in the answer to ""How tall are you?"") we have to seek a ""measuring stick"" that is within the bounds of our experience. So, for example, if we have a limited experience horizon and are surrounded by fairly pessimistic people we might score ourselves highly on the 'optimistic scale'. But after encountering for the first time a happy-go-lucky, outgoing and generally enthusiastic bunch of people, we might feel inclined to revise our score downwards.

It is especially difficult to say how much I agree or not with this theory, as I have no other theory with which I can challange it.

I am deeply appreciating the course's structure, as I feel it gives a good balance between the kind of academic approach I am used to with the resources of the internet. The videos are quite long, but clear and kind of dialuted. The theory is explained first, and in a gradual way; we are given links at the bottom of the page to explain concepts which may not be clear; there are a couple of ""real world"" interviews, which is interesting.

I think others have summarised this well by saying that we don't have a good way of measuring happiness, nor a very clear idea of what it is, so we may be casting about for a way to evaluate it, and we do that by comparing against other people/ the past/ aspirations etc. I suppose this also makes us particularly susceptible to priming and framing effects.

For example, I know that both my hands are the same size, so it takes a lot for them to look different sizes.

Government can deal with certain aspects on one's happiness, like living standards, by setting policies aiming to provide good community, medical, social facilities such that people are happy with their general wellbeing.

I don't think we are always aware of the thought processes, e.g. mentally reviewing our experiences that might be relevant, choosing or discarding ones which might be helpful and then coming to a conclusion for behaviour in this instance. That thinking can happen in a flash and we can be somewhat unaware of it even happening, which has the same effect as the idea of the subconscious - I don't know /why/ I did a certain thing, but I did. And in a way, this chimes for me in a way that some of the Freudian psychoanalytic theories haven't.

That said, I am keen to hear more before I feel confident about the theory. Whilst I could see how the analogy helped illustrate the idea, I didn't find the example particularly helpful. That seems different than a lot of other behavioural questions.

Models are of couse useful tools if they are simple and robust and developed to answer specific questions. And yet risk and predictive models are particularly tricky. A few years back we attempted to take the human element out of the equation by investing in a company developing self-learning big data algorithms which would flag unknown unknowns. The investee company itself then sadly got hit by a 'known unknown' in the form of a major lawsuit. Our panel of experts, across five countries, with several centuries of collective experience behind them, failed to appropriately weight the risk factor of a detrimental lawsuit in our earnings model, so the model wasn't just a bit inaccurate, it was wildly inaccurate. (I didn't weight this risk appropriately either - needless to say.) Likewise, we have got other risk and predictive models widely wrong by failing (in advance) to factor in the risk and subsequent impact of Russia invading the Ukraine. 

Because, even collectively, we aren't great at assessing complex risk, then a human ability to adapt quickly to  a new set of choices could be really useful!

Re: the experiment with the rewards for recruiting other test subjects, I'm reminded of studies that suggest when you reward good behaviour(e.g. children reading books), it implies that the behaviour itself must be unpalatable enough that it merits getting a reward (e.g. reading is dull so Mum has to give be this sticker/sweet/toy afterwards to make up for it), which can actually decrease the continuation of the habit once the reward system is removed.

How should governments measure happiness?  Certainly not by what material goods or wealth people have.  This is far too relative a measure.

1. ""modelling/forecasting human behaviour related to product choice will help industry create products that are more likely to be successful in the marketplace"" and
2. ""this modelling is not an exact science but if it can be improved (he says by about 50% or more, as measured by new product success rates) this will lead to greater investment in developing new products, more innovation, better economy etc"". 

He cites meteorological modelling/forecasts as an example of an inexact science that has improved by a decent amount in recent decades (measured by weather forecast accuracy). It does seem to me he is using this as analogy to imply that the forecast skill of ""social modelling"" can be likewise improved or at least it is not impossible to improve the forecast skill of model involving inexact science.

Broadly speaking there are some similarities between ""social modelling"" and ""numerical weather modelling"" but I think there are enough significant differences to make the analogy quite weak.

The atmosphere is a physical system governed by well understood physical and chemical processes. The uncertainty in weather forecasts derives mainly from:
1. Uncertainty about the initial state of the atmosphere used as the starting point for a numerical weather prediction model. This initial state is a ""best guess"" based on observations, previous model forecasts and additional physical modelling.
2. Solving the physical equations and modelling all the physical processes known to govern the evolution of the atmosphere is computationally expensive and many simplifications are made to make finding an approximate solution feasible (in a reasonable amount of time).
3. The atmosphere is a complex/chaotic system which puts real theoretical constraints on it's predictability at long enough forecast time-scales.",2015-11-17 12:37:47 UTC,,0

The many different forecasts produced can be statistically processed to provide a probabilistic forecast.
Obviously modelling social behaviour is not based on physical laws. I'm not an expert but I believe recent research in this area tends to use ""ABMs"" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_social_simulation). As far as I can these models are heavily tailored for specific purposes, so it is not as well developed as a model based on the physical sciences. I get the sense that creating an agent-based model involves creating a series of rules dictating how agents should react to stimuli or in more sophisticated models the probabilities of reacting in different ways. Some of these rules use well established theories about behaviour, some may be derived from empirical social experiments or data and some may be assumptions or guesses.

In the interview there is no discussion of how useful this human behavioural forecasting is currently to product development/marketplace success. I actually doubt it is widely or comprehensively used in industry. If it has skill/value and is not widely adopted then Rory could instead argue that this approach be more widely adopted rather than just mention the need to improve it. Or perhaps he is arguing it needs to improve before it is compelling enough to become widely adopted and have any impact. The interview rambles on and lacks this sort of useful detail. However perhaps the intent of the interview is more for entertainment and to spark thought/interest rather than to construct a compelling argument one way or another?

I agree with you, I think we definitely are making decisions based on our memories, which are our experiences, which in turn are an intrinsic part of who we are as unique individuals.  I also agree we make judgements/decisions based on comparison, I think that point is mute, it has been proven with various experiments as shown in this course. But I still believe there is a unique quality in each of us, why can one individual achieve so much more than another in different fields, sport, art, music etc.  Practise has so much to do with it, but there has to be  a starting point, a desire or ""talent"".  Surely if a person spent enough time listening to 100 notes they would eventually be capable of identifying each note? Not necessarily everyone who tries, but there would be someone who has that inherent ""knack"" or even just the 'Grit"" to achieve that goal?

I think these experiments show the base level of decision making. However we can and do raise above this.

We gather experience, create a scale and make more objective based decision.

Eg. If repeating the experiment each day we would refer to 3 levels of shock even if only 2 levels given that day.  

Given adhoc question of how windy it is on a given day we would struggle to give a reliable score, instead resorting to comparison of today with a close memory.
Given more thought or perpetration we would collate memory of many days and give a more objective answer.
Given time a scale is created ie. The Baufort scale which describes 12 levels.
With this scale in mind our brain would appear much less flat and swayed by the immediate context.

This may be covered later but I feel there are levels to our decision making.

The point:
Every analogy is always going to different from the thing it attempts to explain because it is a different thing. Obviously. This is why his analogy is an excellent choice:
1. Science and technology have drastically improved over 50 years due to research and development in new technology and more advanced meteorological understanding, and weather prediction has benefited greatly to be more accurate.
2. Behavioural science and computer technology and also neuroscience is also forging ahead in recent years.
Therefore, we can expect (or hope) that these sciences and technology will in the future, as happened with weather predicting, also be able to better predict human buying patterns and strategies so we too can get more accurate predictions in how the market will respond, or how to get it to better respond.

For example, in the UK, if you need goods and services provided by the public sector, you're probably getting poorer. If it were true, though, I doubt material purchasing power affects happiness much once you've got beyond a certain threshold of needs being met.

2. Firstly to point out that 'our lives getting better' is not the same as being happier so the question compares apples with pears. I suppose the right question is, are we happier but we don't recognise it? And so, can we be wrong about how happy we are? I think, to the extent that happiness is a meaningful thing at all, there's nothing more to it than what we recognise/ perceive, at any time when we are prompted to consider it (which I guess answers 3 as well). We might think we were wrong later on when we come to reflect on it again but I don't think we have a good enough handle on happiness as a concept for it to have any more than surface value.

The alternative (or one alternative) is that we dupe ourselves into believing that we are making a highly rational decisions based on a well of experience and considered beliefs - when we are not.  The consequences of that can be pretty awful.

It's a bit like saying that you'll manage bias by keeping an open mind and exploring all sides of a question.  In fact we're all biased because (most of us) are only human.  We all have a heap of baggage that we cart around with us - and that creates our understanding of the world and where we fit into it (which we are constantly re-inventing but with some reference to consistency and identity).

The short term decisions of the market make this reliance even more perverse. 
Maybe the reason centrally planned economys don't work well is because people prefer to make irrational decisions.
There must be some underlying biological advantage to us otherwise we would have died out by now. Or perhaps that is what is causing perverse decisions about environmental destruction to happen. Humanity ignores logic and the rational for short term gratifications.

The economic growth of countries is not guaranteed and will fluctuate with the rise and fall in supply and demand of consumer goods, the growth of technology and the decline in other industries.

Whilst some work is clearly very rewarding, I'd say there is lots of work that is poorly rewarded, micro-managed and extremely difficult to see as being in any way ""meaningful.""

•	The public domain is not the same as the public sector.  The public sector is certainly part of the public domain but individuals, voluntary organisations and private companies can and all do act in the public interest.  A large public domain does not necessarily mean a large public sector or vice versa.
•	The public domain is not a ‘sector’.  It is better viewed as a dimension of social life with its own norms and decision rules.  It is symbiotically linked to the idea of public interest.  It is characterised by citizenship, equity and service.  In the public domain goods are distributed on the basis of need (not personal ties nor access to economic resources).  In this space people are equal partners in the common life of society.  It is a space for human flourishing and the realm of engagement, debate and contestation, or active citizenship.  In it citizen rights trump market power and kinship or neighbourhood bonds.  It is a meritocracy.  These ideals have never been realised in full – but imperfect practice doesn’t negate the ideal (and the neighbouring private and market domains are by no means perfect either!).

•	The public domain is distinct from the private domain in which relationships and benefits are determined by personal ties, and from the market domain in which relationships and benefits are determined by access to economic resources.

The more that the public domain is tainted by relationships and practices associated with private domains (e.g. favouritism and nepotism) and market domains (e.g. power, wealth, commodification) the more people are excluded from its benefits.  By the same token, measures of success in the market domain (throughput, productivity, added value, return on capital) and the practices of managerialism (performance management, audit) have no place in, or suck the life out of, the public domain.  Trust is a vital part of the public domain.

If we are within a group of happy people, would we say I don't think I am as happy as these people and therefore I must be miserable or would being around happy people make us happy.  If I think about teams of people I have worked with, it is those that have most happy people that are most enjoyable.

As far as governments are concerned, if people are happy, they will be more likely to vote for the government!  However to measure happiness is, I think more of an art than a science and in my view it is very personal to an individual whether they believe they are happy and trying to put it on a scale may be appropriate for them personally but may not allow a meaningful comparison with others.  If politicians think they have a measure of how likely that are to be in power, of course they will use it. I do wonder if there is an alternative measure, for example if it can be shown that happy people like to go to the Zoo (made up statistic) and the number of people going to the Zoo increased, therefore people are happier.  It may be abstract but could be better than asking if someone is happy.

They found a statistical relationship between happiness and the logarithm of absolute income, suggesting that happiness increased more slowly than income, but no ""saturation point"" was ever reached. The study provided evidence that absolute income, in addition to relative income, determined happiness.

It's also really subjective what we mean by getting richer. If we use the term strictly in financial/economic sense, than truly i don't believe being rich is equal to being happy. But if we use the term in a much wider sense, being rich could also mean cultural/intellectual richness, it can relate to social diversity or ethical/moral sense of richness.

If we could provide tailored employment that truly takes in consideration each persons strengths and deficiencies and makes allowances for poor health it would be great. This is the rhetoric of the government. In practice the government has cut down the allowance that was in place to pay for reasonable adjustments for people with disabilities at work (such as software to allowed blind person to use the computer, interpreters for deaf staff etc etc).

In a capitalist system that puts emphasis on profits employers want 100% out of their employees. There is no incentive to employ someone who can only give 50% and needs support along the way due to their mental health problems or other disabilities. The exception to that is if the disabled person has particular talents and abilities that make it cost effective to employ them.

The constraints of our massive bias toward the relative/comparative is thought provoking for me when considering, relative to tech, slow cultural advancement.

It's interesting that we don't seem to struggle with absolute and objective evaluations when applying it to others eg to well (if not healthily) fed smart phone owning welfare-payment recipients.

If we can apply the objective/absolute to others then why not ourselves. Will physiological derived biases always drown out cultural progress?

I intended to argue my point with another example (Musical Notes) where we train our ear.
However this was covered in next section.  
I was really surprised that we can not train ourselves to differentiate the notes. 
I thought that a trained pianist would be able to tell which key on a piano was being played.

I thought that person starts not being able to only work comparatively with notes just played.  
However they build up a stored memory of each note on the key board.
They retrieve this note from memory, compare with note just played and confirm if it higher\lower or the same.

I'm finding it hard to accept that we can not train ourselves to overcome the limitations these experiments show.

The Beaufort scale is actually one based on observation eg. level 0, smoke from chimney  will rise up straight. 
We are using our senses to record a level of wind that we can recall and compare.

We do have limits to how much our senses can measure, memorise and hold in our thoughts.
However I do not feel these limits have to hold us back as much as these experiments suggest.

My current conjecture about how our brain works is that it is a pattern matcher and that consciousness evolved as an adaptation to support the fantastic amount of unconscious processing that goes on in our brains.  Our conscious self has a very limited view of what else is going on in our brains and therefore we think everything we consciously perceive is all there is to perceive.  Studies on perception and movement have shown that in order to move our muscles, we create a pattern in our brains and match the actual movement of our muscles against that pattern as we execute the movement, correcting as we go, by matching the actual pattern against the planned.  It has been shown that learning results in physiological changes in our neurons ( a new pattern)  So what are brain does all day long, is assess our situation, build a representation of that, and match it against existing patterns. If there is a match, then there is an automatic response, if not, invoke consciousness. A value or belief is just a pattern, not a thing and it all happens on the fly.",2015-11-19 16:34:25 UTC,,0

A lot of people have the intuition that flying is more dangerous than driving (or at least are more afraid of it); but actually if you look at the statistics,  it’s  not. 
Not true, statistics to give the result stated I think uses passenger miles but if 
passenger trips are considered then flying is more dangerous.

ARI or average recurrence interval is a term used to describe the frequency or probability of floods occurring. 
A 100 year ARI flood is a flood that occurs (or is exceeded)

There is a 1% chance that a flood of this size or larger will happen in any one year. 
The fact that a 100 year flood occurred last year does not mean we won’t get another this year. 

Understanding of flood frequencies in Australia is limited because of the short duration of hydrological records. One additional large event can modify ARI

However I have no idea if someone else's experience equates to my own.

I think the government could be doing a bit more to improve lifestyles for people in general and even if this is about better work-life balance or improving ties to the community by organising more joint projects which involve helping other people or better distribution of that gross domestic profit to ensuring more support for people with problems like depression, anxiety etc, so they don't have to go on long waiting lists to get the help they need right now..also, though , I think people(myself included) would feel more content and at peace if we were not living on edge with the risk of imminent terrorist attacks hovering around..like an ominous tumour spreading like wildfire.",2015-11-20 13:32:41 UTC,,1

Synthetic storms have long been used for flood risk assesment, a combination of rainfall intensity and duration.

Also, alternatively I have been in situations where I am shy to tell people about my successes as this might make others unhappy and I may be singled out.

Do you ever find that its best just to ''blend in'' to social situations, regardless of whether you believe you are happier or unhappier? You start to match other peoples levels so there is little or no comparison ? Or perhaps its just their moods rubbing off on me ?

There are many nuances in any risk decision.  If it is around money, then I believe people can change dramatically and be even more customs. If its just a case of losing a bit of pride then perhaps its always best to go for it and seize the opportunity.  

I believe you need to be aware about the person or messenger asking for the decision, and also what incentives are driving that person/s. 

Some people make things happen, some watch what happens and some just wonder what has happened. I believe a pro-active approach no matter how difficult is best.  If you're going to fail, then do so on your own terms.  Just my personal opinion and it may not agree with others.

It sounds pretty negative framed like this, but I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing! I certainly enjoy videogames, TV, nice clothing, all these commodities that enrich our lives (though I'm certain that there are plenty of purist freegans that beg to differ). 

It's difficult to dissect what we want from what society tells us we want because.. well, honestly I don't think there's much distinction. We're social creatures, to such an extreme extent that it's impossible to remove the ""social"" aspect to evaluate our own behaviors.

I agree with these points, yet I do believe that ""the mind is flat"" is an extremely black and white approach to something as nuanced as the human brain. I don't think we're quite at the point of exploration where we can put forth such a definitive statement.

The proposal is that mental depth is an illusion - that our beliefs, motivations, and desires are malleable to a significant degree and shift moment to moment to suit that moment. That introspection is an improvisation. (1/3)

People put an intense amount of introspective thought towards the things they care deeply about. Participation in a psychological experiment is not going to be one of those things. Picking between two brands of cereal is a decision that is made on a whim, deciding if it's time to try for a baby is not. This was even illustrated in an experiment where political viewpoints were manipulated - participants with strongly held beliefs about certain issues were not fooled or swayed. 

True, these things may have still been the result of a frivolous influence, maybe subconsciously a baby is more desired now merely because all of your friends have children. Maybe you're only viciously conservative or liberal because your parents are and you adopted those beliefs. But, if there was no such thing as mental depth then I'd have to imagine that people could universally be manipulated in the same way. At the same time, people cannot ""improvise"" a debating in a foreign language or writing a fictional trilogy - these things rely on acquired knowledge and planning. (2/3)

So I just answered randomly, to some, and used the same ratio of what I thougth the correct answer was to the bracket I used.

The economist, in his weekly column for the business section of a Sunday newspaper, wrote this rejoinder: ""If people stopped wanting things, then we really would be in a mess!"" The paradox is this: that if we were all really happy and contented with our lot, and were not continually striving to get on, and have more wealth, or wear new clothes, or whatever it is that motivates us to earn and spend, then the world economy would grind to a halt. We saw during the last financial crisis that 'the great and the good' who run our countries don't currently have a Plan B.

I guess it depends on whether you want to focus on the positive or negative, on what you have or what you don't, etc.  So, I guess it would be a matter of perception.  
Is society teaching people to be less content with what they have so that they will continue to purchase more?  Perhaps.  
I'm not an expert in any way, but if governments wish to measure the success of their policies, I think they will have to come up with objective things to measure.  If they are seeking to increase literacy, that can be measured.  If they are seeking to increase happiness, that is more difficult.

For instance (and this is just ONE example):

The experiment given of the holiday destination was confused by at one point describing it as a 'preference' and the next as a 'choice'. These are NOT just two different 'frames' as stated but actually two completely different constructs.... let me explain:

The word 'prefer' = 'in an ideal (fantasy) world', so when asked ""what do you prefer""  I might say the expensive one but that's because I'd 'prefer' to be able to afford it!
When asking ""Which will you reject, if given a choice?"", you are no longer asking for a fantasy (preference) answer so the options are looked upon with consideration to one's circumstances. Since the Bournemouth is within the realms of reality of affordability then I choose to eliminate the fantasy (my 'preferred' destination).

If you change the second question to ""Which do you 'prefer' to eliminate as a choice"" then you keep the two questions within the same construct - fantasy - in which case I'd suggest the answer may be Bournemouth!

Like I say, this is just ONE example. :-)",2015-11-22 13:08:39 UTC,,2

The concept Rory describes on making a product ""good to compare"", hence give it a niche, appeals so much to my first group of decision makers ... the majority.

1) If a decision is mundane or of minor consequence I would say I am a 6/10 many people do not take much notice and auto-pilot is the usual mode of decision making.  

2) However most people at some time, and some people frequently, do give full consideration to matters.

For trading risk and return in other situations - such as engineering decisions for components of a high-speed train, many choices on medical interventions, or political judgements on whether to commit to killing people in other countries, I think shallow thinking a disadvantage - at least in terms of eventual outcomes, though for personal advancement shallow thinking may be more successful even there.",2015-11-22 21:24:05 UTC,,1

Governments should look at how happy the lowest 10% of people are, ranked by happiness. 

So if you have 1000000 people and you can somehow measure how happy 1000 of them are, you order all the happiness figures and you look at person 100 out of 1000 (where person 1 is the least happy and person 1000 the most happy).

Then, to cover for variations — maybe the country just won the soccer world cup — take a moving average over 10 years. That moving average is what governments should target.

(I believe that) happiness will matter a lot more to the unhappiest decile than to the majority of people. Measures to address this could include education, direct transfers (tax rich people and give the money to very poor people), and improvements to mental health services.

I do agree that we consider things in a relative fashion to some degree, and that we are influenced by our environment to some degree.

I find it reasonable to find £1.50 for a tea in town because I'm not just buying tea, but also the convenience of having it made for me in the middle of town (where I wouldn't otherwise have tea), and having it in a nice environment that I wouldn't get at home. You call that context, but I think that's part of what I'm buying. But if tea were £10, not just in one shop but everywhere, then I wouldn't buy it. With video games I often like having a game where for every £2 I paid I get at least an hour of fun from it. So if I'm thinking about buying a game I'll try and work out how long I'll play it for (for example, by seeing how long others played it for). I've found myself thinking this for other things in life too though.

To someone less financially constrained, the scale now changes in relation to this fortunate wealth increase, now reading 6-10. A 2-3 rated chocolate bar is now probably 'too safe/too cheap', and hence they buy a premium brand priced at 7-8. 

Now, think of all the people who make decisions which effect the wider population, a politician for example. Their frame of reference may well be 6-10 or 11-15 whereas the vast majority of the population effected by their decisions may be scaled 1-5. Perhaps, when someone says a politician is helping his elitist peers rather than the general population, we can see that they are only elite in relative terms (think back to the island example in previous video) and that they are blinded to the malady of the poorer populace simply because their scale of relativity is so much different to the majority.

According to a study, the amount of energy/will we can ""spend"" on decision-making during a day is limited. E.g. judges pass better resolutions at the beginning of their work day and not before lunch. When a person is exhausted, s/he is more prone to make more impulsive choices, go with the stream, be malleable and not so thorough. It's important to save the energy for more vital issues because if you've spent your morning choosing between a red silk blouse for xx pounds and a blue jumper for a bit less, or two mostly identical dresses but one has this and the other has that... - you'll ruin the day and be more malleable until you've had a proper rest.",2015-11-23 06:26:16 UTC,,2

The hot chocolate example was very simplistic of course, but a fair introduction to the  more complex field of stock market advice.  The difference however is that an honest stockbroker earns his fee by giving you good advice on which stocks to switch to, and on the risks involved in doing so.   You pay that fee in return for a service given.  Not at all the same thing as the hot chocolate circle.

On the other hand, there are clever, possibly unscrupulous, people who can ""play"" the market, and make huge profits having done nothing but juggle share ownership and buying/selling margins.

I immediately cancelled my existing endownment policy and began to save that money instead. This still didn't take into account inflation, this friend explained and what buys a house now might buy a bicycle in 30 years time, for all we know. So every year I increased the monthly savings amount (which I invested annually) by whatever the inflation rate was that year to keep step. LOL.

Similar, there is little point in buying an expensive car with a cheap system - you're spoiling the ship for a haporth of tar.  Yes, coffee in a shop (whether sit in or take away) is more expensive than at home - depending on your coffee, how you make it, and whether you cost your time.

There didn't appear to be much data around during the GFC to predict how much effect Mr. and Mrs. Average would have on the markets. I believe that it will happen again because Mr. and Mrs. Average are more sensitive because of the information they now have access to via the Internet that they didn't have all that long ago. Risk models require updating more regularly, and stricter financial regulations put in place to govern computer trading.

Once I've bought something, I never (well, almost never) look back on the decision. If i am prepared to buy it at the price offered, then I try to stick by that decision.

They made a rational decision at the time and it is still a rational decision.

I have enjoyed shopping in markets abroad much more since I adopted this approach. No way  is the stallholder going to take a loss on what he's selling me and, if it's worth it to me, that's fine. It's a rational decision. If someone got it cheaper somewhere else, that's their value, not my loss.

As other students have pointed out, the perception of happiness is purely subjective and hence direct comparisons are tendentious at the very least. Happiness is purely an abstract concept like Truth or Justice. There is no automatic instinctive agreement as to its nature but we might be able to agree a common definition to try and ensure we were attempting to evaluate the same thing. Thus we might agree that happiness is defined by material wealth because that allows greater choice and therefore greater self-actualisation. 
I would agree that, insofar as it is a valid concept, happiness is relative. As has been commented elsewhere, Herzberg and Maslow essentially agree that once basic needs have been met, 'happiness' - or rather absence of unhappiness - can only be achieved through self-actualisation. By extension, I believe that it is incorrect to say that it doesn't matter if the rich get richer at a faster rate than the poor.

I've read a couple of Tim Harford's books and listen to his show on Radio 4 'More or less'.  I think if you listen again, you'll realise he was talking about economic models and how they relate to real world situations.  The interview acknowledges that often real people behave differently to what a model predicts.   This isn't always cause for concern as it depends what the model is being used for i.e. predicting the behaviour of an economy as opposed to predicting the behaviour of people.

I think the interview could perhaps have done a better job at explaining that economics works in models that might have utility for certain purposes and does not purport to explain the behaviour of real world people on an individual basis.",2015-11-23 21:43:49 UTC,,7

People were quite happy until it was pointed out that they were buying tat.  Markets also trade on the faith or belief that people have in products (trust) - but what guides that belief is - as we've seen - often far from rational (in an economic sense, at least).

In 1967 I was employed on market research into what users (i.e. big commercial firms) would want from the next generation of computers. Most data processing managers were struggling to get the huge and very expensive computers of the time to meet company requirements and wanted more powerful computers which were cheaper and easier to program. With one or two exceptions none had the time to really think about why computers were difficult to program and why things went wrong. The universal view was that as computers were so successful the underlying design assumptions must be right and you had to live with the snags.
I noted that many of the problems arose because people live in a messy and often unpredictable world while computers were designed for mathematically “closed” tasks of a kind that people found difficult. Even the pioneer design engineers into human-computer research into ""windows"" at Xerox Parc were more concerned with hiding the incomprehensible black box rather than going back to first principles and asking whether an inherently human-friendly information processor was possible.

Now when I go out to buy things, I tend to ask myself if that's what I need and will it actually be of use to me.

My answer is; No, I decided upon a strategy and kept to it. I knew I could NOT 'lose' the money so there was NO RISK... I gambled £50 then paid £5/£10 after that. This was a different strategy to the one for the first game... but there was no rule to say one must keep to the same strategy and I do not feel it makes my mind flat just because I use different strategies for different games.

Which leads me to think that the concept of an absolute evaluation is a furphy anyway. All value is relative. 

I remember a marketer talking about pricing based on 3 kinds of value: intrinsic; extrinsic; and a third I can't remember. One is the value we attribute to the object, one is the value we get from deploying the object and one is the incidental value we get from owning the object, even though we don't use it.

However, there was nothing that did that so nothing to compare it to.

I have a smart phone but only use it as a phone. My real computer does the hard work several hours a day.

If the examples at the end of last week (particularly around car choice) and during this week show is that depth can be developed over time provided there is an interest in delving into the details or developing experience to make a certain choice.
I can believe that when making choices regarding things classed as ""unimportant"" or where there is not necessarily time to develop a deeper point of view into the matter before making a choice then the mind can behave in a ""flat"" manner. 
That's not to dismiss the thesis entirely, as there is a broad range of decisions that people make (such as assigning a number to how happy they are or choosing a brand of jam when shopping or even buying a house or choosing a pension under time pressure) which fall into that category and understanding how that sort of decision is made is important.

It's embedded in all the stuff that surrounds us including the places we live and work and play, and all of the goods and services we use.  Everything.  All the things we create or engineer have a purpose.  How we 'frame' that purpose and hence how we create the stuff has consequences - often unintended if we haven't thought deeply about design and how the 'stuff' will be used (or not used or even abused).  Of course we don't have perfect knowledge and will never have and I'm not arguing for that - but there's a lot of things we do know and can apply to design things better and reduce the unintended (or careless) consequences.  Design is a bit of a Cinderella subject and should (I think) have more prominence in many of the deep social, environmental and economic problems that surround us.

To give one example, the key to reduce/avoid waste is to design stuff so that it can be repaired, re-purposed, dismantled and re-used - or, put another way, designed to er... reduce/avoid waste...!

An expert explained to me that one simple model of value ascribes three types to products/services : intrinsic; extrinsic and instrumental. 

If I remember correctly intrinsic is the value attributed to owning the item, instrumental to 'deploying' or using the item and extrinsic the value derived from appreciating an item. 

So for example some people value cars for their instrumental value - it's a form of transport, but some people value them for simply owning them - luxury cars. It confers social status and makes people feel good. First class air travel probably falls into the same category - it is not valued for its instrumental value, it gets you to the same place in the same amount of time at a level of comfort only slightly higher than cattle class - it is valued because certain types of people define themselves as 'first class passengers' and to travel any other way would be unthinkable.

But it does seem to back up the idea we have no fixed attitude to risk, although it's also possible that context for risk based decisions is an important factor.  Risk taking in games seems of a different nature to risk taking in other scenarios.",2015-11-26 09:19:36 UTC,,0

Demand and supply usually determine market value and if we want something badly enough we will just have to pay market value.  Haggling might get you a small reduction in the price and this alone will probably make you feel as though you've cheated the market and encourage you to make the purchase. The item now has an increased value to you as your perception is that when you come to sell it you will either reduce your loss, break even or better still, turn a profit.  Essentially, you have had the opportunity to enjoy the item at no cost - huge value!

The price of first class is again determined by what people are prepared to pay.  Snob value will put the price up and for those with a large income, the extra cost is relatively small (£1000,005 vs £1000,001) so the comfort value is cheap.  Nevertheless, not every 'wealthy' person travels 1st class - perhaps they are wealthy because they are used to valuing in 'absolute' terms and this is why they are more wealthy?

Once people begin to understand something, can find faults with it, change this and that so it works in the real world, it seems to be that moment a new something turns up that dispels every other something that came before it. If we develop a theory it is only that, a theory. Even if we can gather evidence to support our theory, someone else will gather their own evidence to support their theory and away we all go round, and around on that circular thingy we were talking about earlier.

Making the statement 'the mind is flat', suggest to me that we should consider that the mind is only capable of taking on information, storing it and regurgitating it at a later date.  As an analogy, think of an electronic chess game.  On the face of it, a complex thinking machine, quite capable of beating human beings.  However, electronic chess games are consistently beaten by humans.  Why? Because humans can reason and rationalise, which computers cannot and this, I believe, is because we have the depth of knowledge and understanding to call upon that sets us apart from a two dimensional, 'flat' mind - computers compare, we do more than just compare.

Do we really think that those students in Britain who cannot afford now contemplate going to university in the UK, are not 'less happy' than their older siblings, friend and relatives who have managed to go. So two things arise from Easterli's findings: 1) To suggest poor people when introduced to greater health& educational opportunities would not 'be happier' & then have them withdrawn would not make them 'less happy' is idiotically paradoxical; 2) Perhaps 'happiness' is the wrong concept, should we be not be using the word and more conceptually correct concept 'contentededness'?",2015-11-26 13:30:26 UTC,,0

I'm alternately mystified, confused, and dejected by this course - not that these are necessarily bad feelings.

I'm dejected because I can't help feeling inadequate.    Professor Chater is plainly highly qualified, who am I to question his findings?

The sales offer was that we could have one complimentary device and if that vehicle showed a fuel saving in the following week, then we must purchase a set for the entire vehicle fleet.  Invariably, the salesman wanted to meet the driver and instruct them in its use.

Much depends on where you draw the boundaries of the problem - and whether that is about satisfaction between the seller and consumer (a wholly private transaction) or the extent to which wider public goods are considered (including the social and environmental costs of production).  Markets are far from perfect, but most of the alternatives are far from perfect too (or further from).  But that's not an argument for complacency.  Markets rely on competition.  Sometimes that has been artificially created (e.g. utilities) - and these are especially imperfect with asymmetries of information and poor incentives for companies to invest in essential infrastructure (so they mainly profit by sweating and stripping assets paid for by the public sector a generation or more ago).  Much depends on the overall interplay of the market domain with private interests and the public good. 

Markets also rely on perfect knowledge between sellers and consumers - which doesn't always happen.

I suppose both elements are changeable in order to enable stability (according to 'societies' definition of stable).

However, another spanner to throw in...taking the scenario of being in a relationship. Often when things are going wrong someone will say they will change...i.e. if they don't do much around the house, they will do more, thus become less lazy...but it (sometimes) never lasts...they soon revert back to type once the 'danger' of the relationship breaking down has passed...??

I think it must have something to do with keeping oneself within the 'norm' of the social group. If your tribe/family group is living a peaceful existence, with plenty of food to hand and no imminent dangers to worry about, then risk averse attitudes are better for survival. However, when faced with challenges - e.g. the tribe/family group has to migrate to find new food sources, or re-organise or become innovative to defend against new threats - then more risky strategies are likely to be the better option. In the more challenging situations, the strategy of 'binary comparison of different factors' could have developed as a way of making a group choice between complex alternatives. Maybe it went something like this (in the case where the tribe/family group has to re-locate): location A has better food sources than B, but at B there are more predators than at C, and remember C is not so far away as A, while we've been to B before whereas D will be totally new for us etc. There might also be something here about inter-group communication.

This then impacts expectations (e.g. my kids needn't die from diarrhea/polio/etc) which then creates desire (I want sanitation, clean water, medicines and vaccines to help my kids) and a sense of lack.

On that basis, I think the market's role could be to create choice environments, including particular comparator groups, in which it becomes possible for absolute monetary values to get assigned to goods and services. These prices wouldn't necessarily reflect something stable, and are arbitrary in the sense that something like adding a new product would change the values of the others.

I also appreciate James' feedback, and that there are many ways of defining what 'creativity' is. It can mean different things to different people. When I considered what I meant by 'creativity' in my comment above, I mean the many ways people can work out an approach to solving a problem even though they may have not experienced that problem previously. The human mind will, consciously or subconsciously, start working on possible resolutions to a problem the moment the problem presents itself. The way in which the mind approaches problems and solutions depends upon how threatening a problem is. Every mind is unique in the way it analyses a problem, and shouldn't have issues with 'flatness'. Many problems will not give us the time to think in a linear or circular fashion. I believe that this is how the human race has survived for so long and will continue to do so. 'Flatness' should only occur if every mind worked in the same way and reacted in the same way to every problem. Even if every problem was the same, the mind would find different ways of solving that same problem until it came up with the most 'cost' effective solution. Cheers.",2015-11-27 12:10:39 UTC,,0

Firstly, with so many examples on the course so far relating to cars, it is worth remembering the scandals in the news lately about car performance: these underline that companies do what they can to rig the buying experience. It is not just our flat minds that make it hard for us to make logical decisions. The corrupt sellers falsify the terms of any possible comparison we make anyway.
Secondly, the really important element (elephant in the room?) is the value that any sum of money has to me as opposed to you. Perhaps I am like the multi-millionaire footballer who doesn't understand why a £95 football shirt for a 10 year-old is a ridiculous price. I'll buy ten without thinking. Or perhaps I have an average salary, but I am desperately trying to impress my partner to be, so I'll buy a sporty car regardless of the price because I value the image I believe it lends me.

A lot depends on how you define “Intelligence” and the flat minded way to describe it is to forget that we are not disinterested observers – and come up with a naive definition that amounts to “intelligence is what we can do and animals and machines can’t do.”

We must distinguish between being “intelligent” and having a good memory for facts which have been supplied to us by other humans. Animals clearly know less facts than humans because they don’t have languages, while computers have far more accurate and much larger memories than humans (just think of Wikipedia).

Animals need every scrap of innate intelligence they can muster to survive using their limited memory because they must survive without help. Humans don’t need to be so intelligent (at the biological level) to survive because when in difficulty they can always fall back on their memory of information provided by other humans, or actually ask another human for help.

Computers, when given the rules, can process information in their memory far more accurately and efficiently than humans.",2015-11-28 09:59:43 UTC,,6

Context is more important than abstract rules and generalizations. Fifty years ago I suggested that programming bugs arose because abstract computer program models worked in differently to the way sales staff thought about dealing with customers and contracts. The idea was followed up and a human friendly information system was proposed to allow symbiotic human/computer working on a range of problems which were hard to define in advance. The communication language was called CODIL (for COntext Dependent Information Language) and at the heart of the system was a moving window recording the current context.

For instance in hazardous areas, such as the chemistry lab, you had to wear shoes. Classes were not compulsory – but were well attended because the teachers had to make sure they were interesting. After all children love learning well-presented material from an enthusiastic teacher.
Perhaps the most important thing I learnt at the school was that much of what most people do is habit (both personal and social) and that the establishment position may sometimes be built on quick sand.

- If I need to arrive as fast as possible, and I can afford it, I'll go by plane. And in addition, if money is not a problem for me then I'll think wheter to pay for the business class.
- on the contrary, if I do have money problems (even if I need to arrive really soon) then I'll take the bus because it is the cheapest, and I accept that it is going to take longer, no matter how.

Conventional Artificial Intelligence research finds stories such as the one about Mary and John difficult because it has concentrated on looking for “the rules” for writing the story when the human mind is concerned with remembering patterns and comparing and combining these patterns into stories in ways which may be difficult to anticipate ""the rules"" in advance.

In the 1970’s a leading AI guru, Margaret Boden, was going round talking about AI algorithms for writing stories. At the end of her lecture I challenged her and said that the problem would not be solved until you had a story wring system that understood writing stories well enough to write a story such as “How I wrote the story about …. “
She was trapped because her approach involved a mathematically sophisticated pre-defined algorithm which operated on distinct data. Needless to say she rejected my approach, saying it was impossible.

I had to go back and create a grid of the definition statements of what a flat mind is and also a mind that has depth - which, I'll repeat, was ambiguous. After a few weeks, though, I'm getting a clearer picture.

Although Nick keeps saying these things are 'intuitively thought' (and I would think they are ridiculous assertions) it seems ""depth"" means:
*     Having inbuilt 'absolute' measurements of 'value', worth, beliefs, wants and desires.
*     Which have always been there, never change and therefore never adapt.
*     And our experiences are recorded, clearly and accurately; with easy access.

So if the above 'depth' doesn't exist then one's mind must be flat (not to be confused with 2 dimensional haha)

It's basically the 'Nature verses Nurture' debate, where depth = Nature.

I'm finding lots of snippets of interest but as far as the premise of a flat mind is concerned I've had to just let it go... too many red-herrings (economics and design), bias blindness with regard to experiments and their meaning, etc.  So I'm sticking with it for interest rather than to learn about the mind.

But he may have other motivations, or he may not be rational at all.” 
If you were playing the ultimatum game one time only the rational thing to do would be to take the one penny, but we don’t play games just one time we play them over and over and so you have to do what is going to make people share fairly over the long haul. Even if you have to lose, get nothing sometimes by refusing an offer. 
It’s a matter of survival if someone is unwilling to be fair to share the resources equally punish them. Or you could wind up dying.
It would be irrational for Alex to be rational the same way it is irrational to be a pacifist. If someone always does the rational thing no matter what then they will be at a disadvantage to someone who is willing to be irrational. The only rational thing to do is be irrational.

Nick is making just this kind of error in using superlatives in talking about intelligence. Most of what he has taught us so far demonstrates that, viewed as logical machines, we often do very badly. He then reassures us that we know we are brilliantly clever because, having flat minds, everybody says (including our Professor) that we are brilliantly clever. Our jar of the very best possible quality intelligence is brimming over. This argument is at the same level that our flat-minded ancestors used when they knew we must be the best thing in the universe because everyone says that the earth is at the centre of the universe.

If we are to understand how our brain works we have to stop flattering ourselves with “we are the champions” sound bites. Much of what medical studies have taught us about how the brain works comes from patients where part of the brain failed to work correctly. A good scientist trying to find out how our brains works should concentrate on the facts and avoid the hype.

Once animals start working together in social groups it is far more important because group cohession depends on it. Where there is communal hunting the animal brain may need to be better at anticipating another animal's actions than a human - because the animals cannot compare notes and plan strategies using a sophisticated language.

The way you might perceive a thing, perhaps you have had bad experiences with a snooty 4 x 4 driver on the road being inconsiderate and this happened many times, and the usual about them taking up the roads when they deliver their children to school, it could look pretentious, so the mind is then conditioned to think always in this way.

So, perhaps, your response / reaction will always be to think like this.  Our minds then become conditioning to respond in the same way.

However, you might change your mind, and laugh, if you saw me driving around in my 4x4  - it is tiny and bashed up, a very old Dihatsu Sportstrack that looks out of place with the usual perception smart 4x4s. 

Say a cat always reacts to the banging of a bowl for its food.  If one banged the bowl inadvertently then the cat would still appear.

I hope I am getting this right?  Anyone out there that has any other thoughts or can tell me differently I would be grateful.

For years for years I was actively involved in opposing cuts in the prevention and early intervention budgets for mental health – because the cost of failing to step in early can either result in death (suicide) – or the patient requiring very costly support for many years. The NHS is very bad at looking at future costs and I remember being asked to vote on a motion to close a family planning clinic to save money. I said it was difficult to know whether it was justified without knowing, for instance, the average total cost to society of one unwanted pregnancy – and nobody knew.
I am no longer involved in NHS budgets, and never had to consider dental budgets. I suspect that the money saved by doubling the time between dental check-ups could release money that would be more effectively used in other currently badly underfunded preventative areas of the NHS.

I'm personally very happy that healthcare in the UK is funded out of general taxation. There is still a market (you can go private) but the thuggish competition from subsidised NHS services makes it look very expensive in comparison.

I support having private services, in the old style prior to the last 10 years' changes to the NHS. Seeing how much you'd have to pay for private treatment shows how affordable the NHS is.

People spend very little time evaluating comparable properties (often there will be some nearby that are very similar but not for sale) or determining a fair value. The question becomes “am I willing to pay this asking price?” and not “how much would I be willing to pay to live at this property?”

It's quite worry: really, how can we expect people to 'stand up/stand out' for differing views if the pressures against rebellion/thinking for yourself/innovating are so significant - and, of course, this is influenced by your referent group.  For example, if you identify with groups of people who, say, vote in a particular way, it's going to be more difficult for you to openly express views that indicate a different voting preference - and the risk, of course, is ultimately your exclusion from that group. Yet, we know that 'new thinking' can be a salvation.  I'd be interested to hear your views on how we can protect free thinking - and experiments/theories from social psychology must be able to help here.

For instance, guessing the number of beans in the jar.  In a normal situation, when trying to determine the number of beans in the jar it would be sensible to take them out of the jar and count them but in this experiment, we are asked to guess.  How is it possible to do such a thing?  Unless one has previous experience of jars and how many beans fit into them the guess is unlikely to be correct - little wonder we fail.  However, I can see that we would be influenced by the erroneous numbers that have been added to the piece of paper and that is the real reason for the test, to see how we are influenced by others.  So, in fact, we will all do well in this laboratory experiment, we will all be influenced by others, as expected.

Certainly, as individuals, we would find it difficult to describe the personality of another individual in such fixed terms - yet I am continually surprised by the level of agreement gained from participants faced with the results from completion of personality questionnaires.  And, of course, most modern personality measures focus upon 'preferences' (and preference strengths) rather than absolute predictors.

However unfamiliar or alien a situation, we will behave and there's no doubt about that!  Our behaviours may not be very subtle or obvious or effective - but we will display them (whether the behaviour is hiding in the corner or attempting to dominate proceedings or whatever),  So, where did the repertoire of behaviours come from and what influences their expression in each situation (assuming that there are choices)?  Sometimes, choice of expression/behaviour must come from 'reading the situation' - but where does the ability to read situations come from? Surely there must be some aspects of 'personality' at play here. 

While I think there are some (few) situations where 'we can't help ourselves but to behave like this'. I do think that we mostly have the ability to manage ourselves and choose behaviours.

Our behaviour is only partly determined by conscious factors, therefore the idea of an 'improvising' / 'storytelling' mind appeals to me. However I do believe our behaviour is shaped by complex and continuous interactions between genetic, chemical and environmental factors, some of them more stable than others. Maybe some behaviours, like decisions in isolated and probably less relevant contexts are shaped by the available options and nothing else. However I also believe our brains continuously interpret the environmental information against background information about what is safe, what is not, what results are likely to be expected, etc. based on earlier experiences.

I would say in one respect the logic is the opposite.
When interviewing I want to get as close to the real job environment with all context rather than stripping down to the lab type tests.

However you do not have the luxury of trying candidates in the real world job so are forced towards to lab test side of things. So agree with you that the interview flawed for this reason.

Jenny, very interesting point.  I think it is a slightly different one from the flawed lab test but very relevant to this course.
It shows how we don't use the logic we would like to think in making interview decisions.
This area really interests me.  It is amazing to see factors that influence our business decisions.  Rapport is vital to land that job.  It is arguable that smaller factors such as the cut of your suit, pen you use, accent of candidate all have much more effect than we would like to admit.

For those not as interested as ourselves who have taken this course, business people are often blissfully unaware of 'irrational' influences on their decisions such as recruitment.

We can do more than one task at a time but we appear to be are very bad at it.
It is an interesting area to look at when analysing business meetings where people check their phones and send emails.  

Are they multitasking, ignoring the meeting entirely or using very little of their concious mind on one or other of the tasks.
I think the description that fits best is that they focus on one task and switch to others to scan and see if their attention is needed.

You pinpoint that at the near end of one of the radials and then follow that radial to work out, logical step by logical step, the solution to your problem. You may or may not find one but you keep going. That's what I call a line thinker. However, if you are a creative thinker you may start from the same point, but you're happy to jump sideways if you think the solution may be better found not by following a straight line, but by moving to another radial. You're now thinking in a plane rather than a straight line, so creatively/laterally rather than logically. But the plane's still flat.

Also, I would have thought these forms of social experimentation, using this system, would have died out post-WW2 after seeing the horrors that could be inflicted if humans try to enact a form of social Darwinism (i.e. leading to Nazism).  Alternatively, if they don't try and enact natural selection, but rather 'let it happen' (i.e. I have read posts by people who seem to think that you can simply let group of people die out via war or climate change in order to solve global population problems [however, with closer analysis one will realise even these are often engineered), then what is the point of human cultural, economic, social, spiritual, civilisational advances in the first place?

There is another factor. Language allows high speed teaching of abstract ideas and generalizations - and this uses the brain more effectively.

I agree with you about our personality changing with our environment but also, I believe, our immediate response is governed by our own previous experience, which is essentially what our personality is made up of.

These unique experiences make us what we are.

It is little wonder that the responses are often wrong/mistaken/copied or whatever.  Not having the opportunity to consider a response carefully and instead, having to call upon accumulated knowledge/experience and for that matter, personal character, is clearly going to hamper any decision, especially when some of these examples have come from people undergoing exercises in laboratory conditions.

Mind (Decisions) seems flat in lab experiments.
Mind (Decisions) seem complex with depth in real world.

I am struggling to define flat.

I am seeing that this course shows influences on decisions and how decisions are made for reasons other than logical route to best outcome.
I am not seeing this as flat though.

The concept that the mind is flat gives no weight given to the many things which are distinctive of the human mind: love, compassion, spirituality, humour, irony to name just a few.  These are vital traits of our humanity and cannot be lightly ignored.

The original computers were all serial processors - but could allocate different areas of memory to different tasks, so it was possible to switch from one task to another without ""forgetting where it was."" Under some circumstances switching between tasks can be rapid so it looks as if it was doing both tasks simultaneously. More modern computers now have multiple processors doing different tasks - for instance one processor may just be managing the display, and these work in parallel.

in addition you can have parallel processors where all are doing the same task but using different data. These are used in applications such as weather forecasting where each processor represents the equivalent of one geographical location in a grid pattern. They can be likened to a squad of soldiers doing army drill - lined up in straight lines and moving simultaneously.

Our brain can considered as a network working in parallel but at the conscious level with only a limited number of ""concepts"" (about 5) active at any one time. It is useful to think of our short term memory as representing the part of the network currently active.",2015-12-02 14:17:18 UTC,,1

I think that open markets are a good way of finding what we can afford. As to what we want that is much more complex. If we go into the market with an open mind sometimes that will tempt us and move us toward things we can afford. This can be a negative thing though-perhaps stay out of the market unless you need something.

I don't think it's true that it requires massive cognitive effort and careful pondering to maintain a stable personality. Rather, it requires an awareness of our own history, whether recent or further in the past. Isn't this why those with dementia lose or change their personality over time?

Our personalities could also change. For example, we may also reinterpret past history differently in the light of present events.

For example, this shows that one of the things we were told (that only humans understand 'pointing' is incorrect):
""Especially Louis Herman made an impressive scientific lifetime achievement in demonstrating that dolphins understand referential pointing [Herman et al., 1999], report the presence or absence of objects [Herman and Forestell, 1985], and understand imperative ‘sentences' delivered in either acoustic or gestural format [Herman et al., 1984].

The lab conditions disorientate the individual and hence why they 'lose' the ability to 'think' appropriately. The lab is not a 'real world' situation so individuals start to look /seek ways to think in this new alienating social situation.

But I'm pretty sure that is not what he is trying to suggest. It seems to me that he is challenging the more traditional view that our actions can be explained by a fixed set of values and beliefs (character) and ""hidden"" desires and motives ( i.e the reasons for our seemingly irrational behaviour from time to time).

I also think we have to acknowledge that context is important. Many of us live in a time where we can afford to be individuals and behave in accordance with our character. A couple of centuries ago, I'm pretty sure most people were more concerned about how they needed to act in order to ""fit in"" (i.e survive) rather than stay true to their character.

I do think of more than one clue at a time, in fact I do think of all the remaining clues at once or at least in quick succession to see what jumps out and what fits together. 

As for the cup of tea decision; I always always decide at the time what I want to drink. I drink tea, lots of tea, usually at least two cup per waking hour and often every 15 minutes. I love tea! But I sometimes have coffee or milk or water or fruit juice. I always consider what I want to drink at the time I order it or prepare it.

So I am certainly one person who does not fit that model of mindless consumption.

Even thinking ""I usually have this drink at this time"" is thinking about it, although not much. If I were so uninterested in what I was going to drink I don't think I would be drinking anything. If I can't be bothered to think about my drink I clearly don't really want it.

It's a way of sharing the CPU (central processing unit) between more than one job, and of course relies on the fact that the CPU is very fast and so to the user they may not even know they are sharing the computer (the illusion of simultaneity).  As opposed to multi-processing, where there is more than one CPU to work with, and so more than one task can be carried out at the same time.  As far as I know, we humans can only think about one thing at a time, having only one CPU, so can not multi-process, but merely multi-task (and in my case, not very efficiently at that!).",2015-12-03 11:57:17 UTC,,8

So why cheat?

Why not discard the picture and just start putting pieces together to see if they fit, making patches of completed puzzle that eventually fit together to make the whole picture.
That is how I do jigsaws, when I have the time. It is far more time consuming, far more thought provoking and far more satisfying when complete.

We are trained as children to do jigsaw puzzles in a certain way. The reason for this is because parents want their children to complete the puzzle and children easily get frustrated and then lose interest.

Its a question of estimating risk. Many accidents happen when someone is ""driving automatically"" and doing something else at the same time.

I have a morbid fear of being shocked so I guess I'll let them have all the money and walk away. Maybe that because I could easily walk away.

The more they got impatient and yelled at me to bring whatever I was sent the more I grew scared and touched it again, the pain each time seemingly worse than the former until someone angrily came to get it and tried to open the fridge and got shocked. I guess everyone felt bad then. Thats where I got the fear from. Compare that with me having to undergo medical examination where shocks were applied to different parts of my body. As scared as I was I had to go along with the tests because I needed to get to the bottom of my illness. I guess then it depends on motivation.

I think a large part of our behavior is influenced by our memories, and more precisely - our own interpretations of our memories. It's a little sad to think that we are memory drive constructs in some regard, but when you think about it - it makes a lot of sense. And memories are not simple facts, no, by memories I mean we form stories with each one. Only scrutiny reveals what actually is behind a story - a mere occurrence which we interpreted in some personal way, which probably influenced our behavior.

And that might not actually be a bad thing.

Another think Nick mentioned - our brains have the ability to make sense of everything we do, no matter how irrational it might be observed from another direction.

Animals need a brain to allow them to co-ordinate their actions in the context of what is happening in the environment around them. They need to be able to identify food (in some cases food will be other living animals) and then move to a situation where they can eat. They also need to avoid predators and other hazards. If they are social animals they need to be able to interact with their fellow animals in a way which helps to stabilize the group. The brain is designed to model the environment and automatically adjusts to the situation the animal finds itself in.

The course earlier introduced the concept of game theory in an evolutionary contest, and in any social group evolution will reward strategies which help the animals in the group to interact with each other more effectively. Humans have invented language which allows much more powerful interactions so better interaction strategies to develop.

I see ""We-thinking"" as a catch phrase to describe the way in which our animal brain has followed the obvious game theoretical evolutionary route given that language allows closer cooperation between individuals.",2015-12-04 05:23:37 UTC,,3

Over a period of about 5 million years our human ancestors made simple tools (initially similar to chimpanzees today, who sharpen sticks to make simple spears). Tool-making involves passing cultural skills from generation and over the period our brains very slowly got bigger and our tool making very slowly improved.  
About 100 thousand years ago archaeological evidence suggests there was a switch from slow biological evolution to very much faster cultural evolution which has progressed at an ever increasing rate. 
Such a sudden change followed by explosive growth is explained using catastrophe theory. Basically language reaches a point where cultural information is more reliable than animal-like trial and error learning, so it is better to learn by copying adults. At the same time language using abstract ideas uses the brain more effectively than trial and error learning of hundreds of examples – so we can learn more using less memory space!

The experiments testing our self knowledge demonstrated clearly, we don't know our likes, our subconscious self.  We just make it up, agreed. But to study our behaviour, we better become biologists, as I believe in a substantial subconsciously originated (animal alike) behaviour. When I read that we use the stories to construct our behaviour, was that seen as sequentially? That was not clear to me,  I agree with the other way round and likewise with our beliefs.

If rationality, in the 'mind is flat'  as in the previous video, was about continuity;
about how our relative minds relate solutions and answers to problems via others, or via our previous solutions and actions, than the 'anchoring' effect is about the same continuity.  Thus, to anchor is to be rational.  

It makes sense why anchor; it is rational to anchor.  to be rational does not necessarily mean to come out with the 'correct' answer; rather, follow a rational path.

On a scale of 1 to 10 (where 10 is a ‘believer’ and 1 is not) how much do you now subscribe to the idea of a ‘flat’ mind? It’ll be interesting to compare your answer here your previous weeks and see if anything has changed in either your understanding or appreciation of the idea or concept of a flat mind.
I am definitely coming around to the concept of a flat mind. The idea fits so many situations from mental ill health to mental abuse but of course I am wary of that idea too. If it fits too neatly then I think it is wise to mistrust it. It is consistent with clever people being able to manipulate others and could be used for good or bad by governments or anyone really.

Am I conscious of how or why I make certain decisions? A few, yes but mostly, no. Is a flat mind to do with how conscious we are of how we make decisions or behave?

It seems the 'flat' mind is defined as a mind that makes decisions on comparisons, our current self and present information as influences, and past behaviour in our awareness, rather than absolutes. If this is true, 'flat' seems a strange term to describe it, since what we do in an instant, for example facial recognition, seems so complex.

The further I go through this course the less I think the mind is flat, and I'm at about a 2. The reason is that I think personality is also in large part influenced by our unique genetics rather than experiences and external influences only. For example one sibling from the same two parents may be very logical, perfectionist, driven and ambitious, while another may be creative, laid-back and mellow. I don't think these need to be reinforced by stories told to themselves or others. These two may make decisions quite differently almost from birth.",2015-12-04 22:26:18 UTC,,1

Honey bees for example are able to communicate effectively with other bees of the hive where pollen and nectar (food source) is located and therefore can direct other members of the hive to that location. This communication takes the form of a dance and sharing the food to show the quality and type of food. It is also speculated that they use sent of the flower to identify it to other bees.
Humans seem to use emulation methods to communicate this idea of ""we or us"". Putting food towards your mouth before giving it to a baby may install a shared and pleasurable experience. However not all of this is positive. 
Consider behaviours that are not generally accepted as socially acceptable in certain cultures. Often these behaviours are carried on through generations because that behaviour is what has been copied.

- Are they really more stable or is that just a false perception?
- If they are more stable in the real world, why is that?
- If it's to do with trying to be consistent with past behaviours, is that meant to be happening at a conscious or subconscious level? (I certainly don't have the explicit experience of making an effort in this regard!)
- And how much is this like the process an author goes through in creating fictitious behaviours for characters (a process that I don't have much information about!)

I feel that the ""we-thinking"" model is appropriate for a business course when the aim is to teach the students to work together as a team. It needs to be included in such a course because many commercial (and at a higher level political) problems are due to misunderstandings in anticipating how other people will react to our actions. It is important because often we don't do it at all well and things go wrong.
However on a psychology course, where students are interested in how our mind works, what makes us intelligent, etc., what is important is how we react to, and communicate with, the external environment. Interacting with other people is just one part of this. Everyone has to build a mental model of things they interact with, be they other people, a pet dog, their computer or mobile phone, their garden and the plants in it if they want to grow their own food.

Based on former information, it would seem that the damage to memory depends on the severity of the epilepsic episode, it varies with patients. The main parameters and founfdations ( read memory anchors) that seem to set personality happens while in childhood, some say 7, others say 11 yrs. After that what one, without brain disorders,  does is to modulate, fight, come to terms,accept thoese strong main personality forces set early.

Of course the GC movement was abandoned and other elements of planning have occurred , but to state it all happens to us organically is to suggest that humans with the ability to be complex beings are the subjects of Fate.

From a Behavioural Ecologist perspective he calls humans organisms. I would contend that this could be seen more clearly from the sociological perspective of Durkehem. He argues that humans are socialised into their society by the passing on of culture through the first socialisation agent the family and then the second socialisation agent the education system. 
We then begin to internalise those values and they help us to negotiate the complexities of that society. I find this is a more coherent and realistic perspective than the Darwinian behavioural perspective offered here. I recognise the the evolutionary argument may validate our present state in terms of the natural selection. However it does not explain why we as humans continue from that biological perspective to maintain the life of people with mental illness, disability etc. Humans have the ability to live with imperfections in terms of biological evolution. Imagine if Churchill, who suffered with depression had been seen as not being optimised as an individual. What of the art and paintings Van Gogh. >",2015-12-05 13:52:30 UTC,,4

After all it was the foresight and 'planning' of Churchill that challenged and confronted one of the most abominable racist regimes this world has known.

Like Alex I am not enthusiastic following the discussion on this level because as the complexity of human culture and how multi-layered it is vis-à-vis molecular biology or genetic transmission. Other animal species are not always directly comparable with humans.

I suspect it is dangerous to delegate our happiness to a government. It is not their job to resolve an issue which is relative to an individual or group judgement.  And it is nonsense to create measure which reflect society in general as they will simply not have the granularity required. 

Governments' role is to provide the infrastructure of our society so that an individual can make the judgement.  In this sense the overall economic context plays a role (relative to a comparison) along with facilities such as schools, hospitals etc.  But it goes no further than ensuring a fair and equal access to such facilities.  

I think it is dangerous for governments is to mix these roles.  Governments are no good at happiness - it is an emergent property of their policies AND a lot of other stuff.

I have no problem in accepting we reinvent ourselves moment by moment though.

Our brains learn to process sensations into perceptions from before birth, and what we learn is heavily dependent on our social environment. Our brains / minds / bodies develop with their genetic potential plus the epigenetic changes in which genes are activated and how much, imposed by the environment. This determines how our genetics are expressed. It is well known that what we learn during early childhood tends to have strong influences throughout our lives, due to our basic brain wiring being established in those years. This argues against a flat mind, but rather one that has deep roots in the knowledge and concepts that have formed and been reinforced over our lifetimes. Changing people's minds is notoriously difficult when things that matter are in question. People act in character, especially when they are not thinking about their behaviour. All these point to our minds and actions having depth, consistency, and socially developed boundaries. I think Prof Chater comes from a post-modernist paradigm.",2015-12-06 22:42:37 UTC,,6

For tough situations, however, like ( choosing a career, buying a house, changing jobs, migrating to a different country, stepping out of the closet, etc.) these decisions are not taken so flatly.  People often think a long time or ask for advice, many times just to confirm already taken decisions, but ask them anyway and ponder a lot (not flat). Another important aspect not discussed here is INTUITION.  As has happened so many times to us, the answer comes to us in the shower or while walking, but once we have fed our brain with different information, analysis, worries, pondering. And voilà, we suddenly get this insight to solve a problem! Most of us have experienced this. The narrative idea is not convincing. I do find people rationalize their justification of decisions taken, often to smooth out their responsibilities.

1. Yes, Nick has gotten away from flat minds, and isn't signalling where this area fits with the earlier ideas. 
2. Many pack animals communicate and corrdinate their actions in novel ways (e.g. wild dogs, wolves) but don't develop ways of using tools. 
3. Humans are so different, as Christopher Reynolds says, partly because we evolve culturally, rather than biologically. We learn culturally too. 

I believe our progress has been due to the combination of sophisticated communication, plus tool design and use, together with group-belonging and both social and personal identities. All these can happen due to the way our brains and bodies are organised and coordinated. 

I think humans have four basic drives, not two - selfishness, altruism, and also group belonging, and social commnication and learning.

We are notoriously bad at knowing what actually makes us happier and making those choices. We default to watching TV or eating junk food or spending money we can ill afford to spend, even though those activities do not usually contribute to happiness, and certainly less likely to do so when done on autopilot. We also don't know the side effects of our choices with money - so in the US, where lots of people have big homes with large private backyards, there is a view that this had removed a lot of the sense of community that develops when everyone takes their children to the park to play. The diluted community actually can have a greater negative impact on happiness than the positive impact of convenience. And of course, bearing in mind the Easterlin paradox, if we're constantly comparing life to our facebook newsfeed, we will be very unhappy.

I have long believed that people are less complicated than we give ourselves credit for (in the sense that we don't really choose a lot of our reactions) so this course supports my intuition. There has been talk of following the herd and this is behaviour that we see all the time in various human communities. We also see plenty of examples of people being manipulated on small and large scales (con men and dictatorships).
I was scrupulously honest on the questionnaire, according to my habit. I may not be so honest in every situation - I sometimes give false reasons when I don't want to accept a new work contract, for example (I'm an English trainer so always have several contracts running concurrently). As to how I make decisions, it depends on my mood and my circumstances and who or what is affected by the result of the decision. I'm quite sure that I could make a different decision about exactly the same thing if any of those factors were changed.

In pharma there are lots of protections that prevent other companies from producing the same product, in which case the ""market"" is really different, and so is pricing. In food there is much more room for competition and prices usually reflect that. 

Luxury products are less of a ""need"" and more of a ""want"" and I guess in general here there isn't much of regulation or protection. It plays both on supply and demand as well as on other factors (""hidden agendas"").

Unstable or inconsistent behaviours may be associated with mental illness but, of course, this raises the issue of the Soviet-era abuse of psychiatry to assign political dissidents to mental hospitals on the basis that their opposition to the state was, by definition, illogical. 
I would submit that a more relevant genralisation than the deep/shallow contrast presented here is the introvert/extravert differential.  The extrovert personality is much more likely to conform to social norms and be influenced by the view of the group. Conversely, the introvert is more willing to 'take a stand' or adopt extremist positions by virtue of the fact that he/she is less willing to compromise with other people with whom relationships are less valued.",2015-12-07 19:09:33 UTC,,1

There is so much evidence for consistent and persistent depth in belief systems for most people, that I wonder how Nick can ignore it.

Which I think are two different skills.
We certainly have genetic potential for learning, as do other species. I stumble on how this relates to the mind being flat, as potential for learning, to me, indicates complexity. I also struggle with why we are being asked to believe that this is probably an exclusively human quality; if this ability is present in young children because it is genetically based or pre-wired, how is this different to the collaborative, collective or reciprocal behaviour animals display, which is also pre-wired?

We-thinking does not allow coordination - it is the reverse, communication promotes and facilitates we-thinking. Of course, there are differences between humans and other animals but It would argue that these are largely not fundamental but more levels of expression. In other words, communication, both verbal and non-verbal are highly developed in human beings and this allows sophisiticated levels not only of cooperation but also of learning. A termite or bee colony is  also a higly complex communications network using chemical rather than verbal cues.  The bee article also mentioned that bees of different species were able to learn to interpret different dialects of the waggle-dance and could learn to associate particular colours with food.

We can reach out and grab for things we know are there but have not got in sight at the moment and we call that 'memory retrieval'. If the thing we want is not on the table we can visualise it and put it on the table for real - we call this 'invention' or 'imagination'. Sometimes we mistake what we have pulled into view or it looks like something else we know is on the table - 'change blindness' and 'mistaken identity'. Why this is a 'flat' view is because it is a viable alternative image to the more established and familiar three-dimensional 'filing cabinet' or 'memory theatre' visual concepts.

It is not so much the fact that the human participants are trying to move the table in the most efficient way - that comes later, if the same task has to be repeated over and over. It is more that there is an objective to be achieved and the human participants work together to achieve that objective in the way that they would have decided to do so if they had been given the opportunity to discuss the task beforehand. And ... they do this WITHOUT DISCUSSING FIRST HOW THEY WILL WORK TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE IT. And further ... this is not instinctive or genetically-engineered behaviour (e.g. as with wolves hunting in a pack); it is something beyond that, which may very well be an ability that is unique to humans. Why we're on to Game Theory now is that it essentially tries to apply a set of rules to human behaviour, whereby every individual follows the same set of rules, and by analysing the different possible ways in which the 'game' can be played the theorists attempt to predict the outcome.

I read one researchers view that our ability to read and write is due to the physical proximity of two brain areas,  one involved with visual processing that recognizes straight lines, and the other associated with words.  These parts of the brain have some neuronal overlap between them and learning to read and write, actually builds new neuronal pathways and connections, to the point where it all seems natural and hard to conceive that it wasn't always that way.

This human ability to contextualize easily with others certainly gives us extraordinary power to work together. It allows many to organize with different roles to work to a common objective over a short or long time period.

In 1966 I was involved in planning the move of a  very complex commercial system  (250K customers, 5K products) to the next generation of computers which had terminals. I suggested a way in which the sales staff could understand and symbiotically control the system from their terminals in order to dynamical follow changes in products, customer requirements, market movements, etc. Within a year I was project leader looking into the design of a “computer” system with a human friendly symbolic assembly language. The project, despite many technical successes, eventually folded because it was incompatible with how the computer establishment thought about computers.

Now long retired I have decided to reassess the abandoned research and it would seem my “human interface” was modelling short term memory. The early research can be remodelled in terms of a network of neurons, which can morph into a powerful information processing language. In addition the research suggests an evolutionary route that explains why human intelligence suddenly appeared.

Our ability to socialize, interact, coordinate behavior and work together is crucial for living successfully in a community and of course also distinguishes us from animals. But we don't only do that to survive, but also because we need, love and seek social interaction and the company of others.

I can acept that we see the surface, but insist that there are hidden depths of connected ideas, values, and beliefs under what we can see immediately, that can be pulled up to the surface as they become useful. When they are, their connections become available to our consciousness too. By growing these connections we build our personalities, habits, and characters, as well as fitting into our cultures. 
They are 'deeper' because it takes quite a lot of effort to change them due to their large number of connections that would need to be changed at the same time. This metaphor fits closely with what I know about the neural structures of memory.

So there is something in our ability to cooperate that makes us unique among other primates or even other human species.

I am glad for your mother and, at 77, the NHS looks after my physical welfare pretty well.

An example from Lion alert: https://lionalert.org/page/predatory-behaviour

Studies of the tactics of group hunting by lions give a similar basic plan of the hunting process. When the group spots the prey a hunt is often initiated by a single lion looking at it, to which the other lions respond by looking in the same direction – the only clear form of “communication” evidenced in the hunting process. The group fans out, with certain lions stalking at a greater distance to encircle the prey. The encircling lions launch the attack, seemingly to drive the prey towards the others who ambush from their cover position.  

It is suggested that lions often, but not exclusively, followed the same hunting patterns and divided lions into stalking roles; left, centre & right wing positions. Lions hunting in their preferred roles increased the success of the group by 9%.

The course presenters are forgetting that today, however, the concept of liberalism has been remodelled into neoliberalism, combining classic liberalism with a ‘concept of control’.  Without this Adam Smith's philosophy would have died out, as the unaided 'trickle down' effect has been disproven.

Governments, the media and business reinforce values of economic progress, driving the movement of globalisation and, in many cases, economic ‘rationalism’.  It can be observed that this is causing a shut-down of many processes and services aimed at helping people and the environment (as opposed to increasing the country’s Gross National Product). With an ever increasing gap between rich and poor, both on a global and on a national level, people and countries are ‘competing’ or ‘fighting’ with one another to come out on top.

As long as people care only for problems around self-actualization, determining happiness has all these kind of problems as mentioned before. When it comes to more basic problems like (see refugees) in terms of physiological problems or safety problems, happiness is detectable more directly. Once they get food, clothes and a place to stay in, without fear of life-endagering activities around them, they radiate happiness. Once they experience this as ""normality"" they also focus on the next levels of needs like belongings, esteem. So I guess once your society focus more and more on self-actualization and this is your ""only"" problem, you measure more and more by relative means.
Governments measuring the coverage of physiological needs, safety needs may have a linear improvement rate of happiness in times of improving thos. The more it comes to abstract levels, the more it comes to finding the right balance of governmental intervention/non-intervention to supervise powers of society.

Also, relinquishing the tendency to be hunter gatherers and realising that it would be more productive to settle, raise crops and set up static social communities. They would have needed to plan (e.g. planting, harvesting), have the ability to organise labour as well as try to ensure some form of continuity through ritual and belief systems appealing to a higher agent that would ensure fertility of crops, also within the community.

A simple-minded brain, with little need for handling numbers or risk, is all that is needed.

About 100,000 years ago our ancestors invented a powerful, self modifying tool called language. This allows us to pass learnt information from one individual and includes speed learning facilities which means that information can quickly be exchanged - and stored much more efficiently through the use of abstract ideas. All this happened in a twinkling of the eye compared with genetic evolution - so we find ourselves with a simple-minded brain supercharged with far more information than it evolved to handle.

As society has expanded it has got harder to understand, much less control, because we are constrained by the logical limits of our animal brains.

On a purely intellectual level I agree with you.  If the theory of this course were simply about understanding the world around us, then it is interesting, thought-provoking and challenging.  

The key issue I have is that this theory is not existing in a vacuum, and as is more explicitly set out in week 6, the theory is being used to change people's behaviour and to socially engineer public policy.  For example, Nick is on the advisory board of the Cabinet Office's Behavioural Insight Team (BIT), popularly know as the 'Nudge Unit'.  Now, when you look at the activities of this team many are very laudable (e.g. in the interests of public health), but the point is that if you apply a top-down economic theory to public policy, then the process is fascistic, rather than equitable.  It allows the people at the top, using psychology, economics and behavioural science, to manipulate the public into behaving in particular ways.  Also, it means they are making decisions based on 'natural selection' rather than by using a set of just and ethical principles.

Basically, it is a 'right wing' economic theory, so biased, and this should be explicitly stated by the course presenters.",2015-12-12 23:07:52 UTC,,4

Any government that has a top down model is adopting aspects of fascist ideology (the extreme right wing is inherently hierarchical, the extreme left wing believing in complete equality - most societies today are somewhere in the middle, not at the extremes). The conservative party in the United Kingdom has some elements who support fascism, other elements which are more based on conservative policy and free enterprise along a neoliberal agenda.  If you examine history, and how Germany's government was structured in the 1930s, there are negligible differences between this and how we structure governments today.  As such, if there isn't transparency and excellent checks and balances, any government using a hierarchical top-down approach has the potential to flip into an extreme regime.

Ants can morph their members (changing their morphology to suit their needs into specialized supersized clawed soldiers, or blocking head guards etc.) at will; humans are not even close to doing that. Successful non-human species do not destroy their environment as humans are doing, they have learnt to reach a quasi-equilibrium state with nature, something that humans do not understand or want to. Finally, why is there such an urge to make us feel so special? Looking down to other species does not help us to understand our limitations.",2015-12-13 15:50:50 UTC,,3

Government tell us to eat healthily but that message is overwhelmed by every food outlet that has ever advertised their yummy food.
For a start the sheer volume of food advertising eclipses the government message, and secondly the quality and impact of the food advertising is far superior.

English is very difficult and complicated mainly because so many of our words are phonologically identical but mean totally different things, and the elongating use of vowels mean a different word entirely. Some languages, like Polish, are even more complicated by far than English.

Pat says I made €500. The farmer asked did any one complain about it?                  Pat says only the winner and I gave him his €2 back

Is it not valid to compare now with history and as Adria does below take stock of relative improvements: then look to build on this?

We have said flat mind appears irrational in the lab but surprisingly effective in dealing with the complex real world, especially when we work as a group.  

Should we accept that our 'flat brains' work together to form acceptable goals and use measures such percentage involvement in shaping and contribution to achieving the goals?

Equally interesting is the constant struggle to accept that language changes, just as we do and society does. The declining standards of what is viewed as 'correct' is centuries old in all languages.

Also in 1984 ‘doublethink’ is widely used as part of ‘newspeak’ where peer group pressure forces citizens to accept two contradictory beliefs as correct.

These profoundly totalitarian human societies are very rigidly controlled by an elite hierarchy, a controlling layer of those that know best for each citizen. Given Nick’s assertion that “If what makes people happy is partly determined by the social norms, the conventions, and the customs that they’re in...” it could conceivably be that the process of evolution may tend to pull society in a very uncomfortable direction of totalitarianism rather than utilitarianism.

I believe that long before we had complex language, we were motivated by feelings and those feelings helped keep our small bands together.

Another condition that makes us happy is being in a 'flow' state of work, immersed in activity.  To me, these feelings make sense from an evolutionary standpoint because they are activities that help bind the group.  A good society would be one that offered plenty of opportunities to experience these situations.  Ones that both fostered cooperation and immersive work.

Culture is not so hard to understand, it's just another set of rules most of which are shared across the planet. Again complexity comes from the addition of yet more rules and trends along with some rules becoming obsolete.

What humans are good at is freezing time in our minds. The ability to do that enables us to extrapolate consequences and plan for different situations in advance.

In my experience there are few people who can be truly honest with themselves, religious people top the list of self deceivers. Most people simply can't be bothered to go deep into their own mind to reveal their true motivations and that's fair enough, most people need to be led.

I found it exceptionally interesting as I am currently reassessing new aspects of a research project called CODIL which was a ""blue sky“ project that was lost in the stampede to exploit computers.

The research started from a 1967 design study into moving a vast commercial system from batch processing system to handle online input. This suggested changes to a computer CPU could make it fundamentally human friendly and far more flexible.

Viewed with the benefit of hindsight after doing this course, the original design study modelled the flat-minded way sales staff thought about pricing invoices – using a limited context “short term memory.” The later experimental studies demonstrated how such a foundation could support a wide range of sophisticated tasks. Another part of the re-assessment allows the “short term memory” to be mapped onto a neural network – suggesting an evolutionary pathway linking simple animal brains to human intelligence.

I totally agree with you that society is amazing and beautiful and wonderful in some aspects, but our bed of roses has thorns. I would like to see the removal of as many thorns as possible, just looking at the flowers in our bed of roses doesn't improve anything at all. It is the duty of leaders to nip those thorns off if society is to move to the good. Today's society has leaders, at all levels, that allow those thorns to persist for non-altruistic reasons. I accept there are exceptional leaders who I would regard highly but I'm not challenging that.

I see the nature of society in general as entropic and will tend to break down where there is a lack of shared concern (when we all want to do our own thing or things only within a  family unit). Societies do go backwards there are plenty of examples the Dark ages being one. The average intelligence in the UK, and elsewhere, is in decline (Google it).

Without robust reinforcement of socially ethical rules the society will tend to disorder and ultimately fail.

The message was that humans as a species survived by working together, and I often think of this when people start to get a bit negative about society.  If bad deeds were really human nature then it wouldn't be in the news, it would be in your life.  So I totally agree with the assessment of 'we think' and how humans use this for the benefit of all.  Sure a few will try to manipulate this trait (economists) but it doesn't make it representative of all humanity.

I don't doubt that there could be some truly excellent teachers lurking inside some soldiers/ military personnel.
My point is the education system, as it is now, cannot attract sufficient numbers of people who want to be teachers. This has led to having to recruit from people who's first choice was not teaching in schools.
The point is, teaching in schools is not that attractive anymore.
Ask the question why?
From what I have seen teachers who would be excellent leaders don't want the management role because of, in general, the bureaucracy. That leaves a lower average standard of candidates for the head and deputy head roles and lowers the candidate numbers overall. Poor management drives teachers away from teaching. This seemed to start when head teachers were required to be more like business managers than leaders of learning establishments.
In short if government want more bureaucracy from schools they should pay for the extra staff needed to provide that. The government have managed to degrade the whole system by replacing teaching time with form filling on the cheap.

A few months into our stay, he started to speak again. This time in English... This against a background of us always speaking Swedish at home or as a family.

Secondly, perhaps one of the important things religions do is to invite us to evaluate our actions independently of the society we happen to find ourselves in. For example, in this course empathy ""putting yourself in someone else's shoes"" has been discussed a number of times especially in the context of ""we thinking"".

I think the insight that people are essentially enmeshed in their physical, social and cultural surroundings (to the extent that there's little left when you remove them from those) means we need to shape our political structures in ways that reflect those, both in processes and outcomes. 

That's obviously pretty vague, as stated, but I guess it might at least rule out some approaches, e.g. Those which are ideologically set on deregulating in order to maximise freedom for freedom's sake, or those which encourage selfishness and competition at the expense of the collaborative aspects of human societies.",2015-12-18 20:16:49 UTC,,1

For example some languages do not count to more than five, others do not use the future tense, others do not use the singular person, others do not allow the use of a personal assertion unless the subject has actually been witness of the event being talked about, others split the meaning of being into space and into existence, etc.  So, essentially, languages evolve not for or because of easy acquisition, but for ""fitness""/accuracy for describing the reality of worldly and self-experience.

I do understand the concept of ""flat"" but I would use another word to describe it better - illusionary. We have this feeling of continuity and sense even when such is none to be found.

I work in the user experience field. The materials of this course match exactly the findings of my colleagues, as well as my own. People's preferneces are unstable. Peope are not aware of their behavior. Yet they are convinced they are. The whole field is full with approaches, frameworks and techniques which allow the designer to reduce this noise and extract valuable data which will actually make the experience better. And it sometimes works :)",2015-12-19 07:36:38 UTC,,1

For me the premise that the 'Mind is Flat' is completely unproven; it may even be oxymoronic - the very fact that we are able to consider, analyse and reflect on whether the 'Mind is Flat' suggests that it has depth.

That we often make quick and irrational decisions is beyond dispute.  But it is also beyond dispute that we have incredible reasoning capability, insight and the ability to imagine and think through future scenarios - a depth of thinking that has evolved to give us better survival capability (coupled with the more responsive flight or fight mechanisms of the mind).

There was a tremendous course earlier this year which explored the question ""What is Mind"" and worked through quite scientifically (rather than what I would call the pseudo-science of marketing) the evolution of Mind and the rationale for its depth.

On the plus side there have been some interesting interviews on this course and experiments. But it has left me wondering whether we are all part of a big psychology experiment into on-line gullibility!

We also have a mechanism somehow for parallel thinking - subconscious thought perhaps. How many of you have experienced those epiphany moments (ahha!) When you suddenly seem to have the answer to something which you hadn't been thinking of at the time. 

I do do crosswords and one thing I have noticed is that I can be stuck on a clue, put the crossword down, go away and do something else not thinking about the crossword when suddenly  'out of nowhere' the answer to the clue pops out.

Whether comparing their lives to their own life years ago, or to other people's lives, we do seem to compare our lives in order to decide whether it is good or bad.

For example, using comparison a person may think their friend is more successful, or has a more fun life, but they probably don't have a full representation of their friend's life - they might not know about financial worries, or family problems etc. Also the hindsight bias comes in here again - we might look back on our lives and in hindsight think that last year we were much happier, ""the good old days"" and all that, and disregard some of the negativity in the past. 

I think if our perception is that our lives are not getting better, then they are not. However, it is up to us to notice our tendency to make these 'comparison errors' when evaluating how happy we are.

We always look back at previous societies with horror at their cruel or evil or barbaric or idiotic or whatever practices, while at the same time being totally blind to our own. I'm sure this has been true of all human societies of all time. 

I was raised a Catholic, and my 3 sons still laugh at me over all the utter nonsense I tried to install into them, while assuming I was teaching them the 'right' way, of course ha ha ha. Fortunately they outnumbered me, ignored my ridiculous beliefs and advice, and instead followed the norms of the kids, school, neighbours and others they grew up with, in and around. Eventually they brought me up and re-educated me. 

There is no such thing as right or wrong, good or bad, but thinking makes it so. Even cold blooded murder of hundreds of innocent civilians will get you honoured as a hero and a gold medal, if your country sent you out to slaughter in their army. ",2015-12-19 18:37:57 UTC,,3

And this is a big problem for people who want to change 'society' to make people happier. I'm not saying don't change, or that change isn't needed - and I'm certainly not saying happiness isn't desirable. Rather, I think, happiness is a sign that other important things in our internal and social lives are going well or improving, and those things are impossible to quantify: can we (and others) express ourselves creatively? (as you suggest); do we feel loved? secure? do we have people we can show love to?

This is a really interesting way of looking at it. (Although I can think of a few languages that have not been selected ruthlessly enough, in that case.)  I wonder, is there evidence that language, or any given language, becomes easier over time?  English is constantly acquiring new words to add to its already enormous vocabulary, so it's not getting easier in that sense.  Irregular verbs  (apart from a few common ones) seem to be on their way out,  and the English subjunctive has pretty much gone, so does that mean the grammar is getting easier?  I'm assuming the subjunctive is not difficult for people who grow up using it, but nowadays languages  need to be learnable by non-natives too.

This makes policy development particularly difficult, a point which is not recognised by those who want to model it on private sector processes.

Regarding the critical/ cynical comments below, there is good and bad in the public sector, as everywhere else. We need to think about how to improve policy and service delivery.

We are all easily swayed by opinions and beliefs and choices fed to us. We are told what to like, who to hate, what (or who) to fear, what is good, bad, right and wrong. We are told what we 'should' do and shouldn't do. Society and culture indoctrinates us and only the very, very few make up their own minds, only the very, very few look deeper into things and question the status quo, and mostly such people are seen as mavericks, rebels, nutters, trouble makers or weirdos. 

Most people do not want to hear your opinion if it is 'way out there', and most people roll their eyes and walk away if you try to disagree with and debate 'common knowledge facts'. We generally reject people and opinions and ideas that are way different from our own. We feel safe and comfortable among the people who think, feel and believe as we do. These things we have in common give us a feeling of belonging, a reassurance that we are 'right' and confidence that we doing the 'right' things. Very few are brave enough to step out of the mould.

We are not free thinkers, generally, and we have absolutely no idea how to be free thinkers because we are thoroughly programmed. In familiar settings and circumstances we know exactly what we like / don't like, want / don't want. prefer and so on, but when we are in totally unfamiliar settings or circumstances, we haven't got a clue.

For some time the children experience confusion and frustration, but with time they learn the languages surprisingly well, without accents in some  cases.  But it depends on the cultures external and internal to the family. For example, where the external culture is intolerant to either or a given  ethnic background, the children will not learn the language at home, and in fact , they will not only avoid it but will want to embrace  the local country culture and language only, and not the family’s ,  because of  being afraid of feeling rejection and not being accepted as equal by the external society.

The Skidelskys tackle these questions in their excellent book 'How Much is Enough' - a summary of the main arguments is here (https://www.uclouvain.be/cps/ucl/doc/econ/documents/How_much_is_enough_27-28_May_2011.pdf)

One of their arguments is that at least in the UK we have lost the dialogue of 'what is the good life?' which dominated philosophy and politics for more than 2000 years.  Without it, faced with a measure like GDP the only 'sensible' thing to do is to make it bigger.  Even if you replace GDP with a measure or basket of measures on 'wellbeing', if you still don't have a notion of 'the good life' then you jump from the frying pan into the fire.  All you can do is make your wellbeing measure, or basket, bigger (more growth).

There are literally thousands of measures proposed for wellbeing (often competing) - and they are still not enough.  At least partly this has to do with many of the factors we've discussed on this course.

Nick's circularity argument and questioning is perhaps the most fundamental aspect and legacy of this course.  Can we break it? Does our (flat) mind allow us to realize where to start looking at this self-reinforced circular phenomenon to cut into? If we accept as evident and true that we are modulated by our flat minds, does the flat mind per se leave us room for us to realize and gain insight into how this flatness process is conditioned into our brains as we are raised, educated and shaped by society? If we understand how this conditioning of mind takes place, then the circularity viciousness , perhaps, can be untangled.

Firstly, of course to Prof Nick Chater for his time, effort and expertise in putting together this thought provoking and interesting course. I have to confess to a suspicion near the start that this could just be a vanity project to see whether you could get people to sign up for and follow a course based entirely on your own speculative theory. Then towards the middle, like a number of others have mentioned, I wondered whether we were all part of an experiment intended to prove some part of that theory. So, Is the Mind Flat? No, of course it isn't, but along the way I've learned some interesting things, from how we can only judge by comparison, to how the context impacts how we receive a message, to how elements of culture evolve. 
Secondly, thanks to FutureLearn for providing the platform and mechanics for the course. This was my first MOOC and will definitely not be my last. I can honestly say that discovering FutureLearn will change my life. >>>",2015-12-20 23:18:29 UTC,,2

I can relate to this as moving from part of the country to another, you find different common behaviours, etiquettes and boundaries in social circles. 
Its as if the ''collective'' bubble in some social scenarios has been formed.  
For example, when starting a new job you often find set groups of people behaving in certain ways, Almost like they have inbuilt habits.  You find you gradually mould into these yourself.

These circumstances, will surely create a whole new set of ideas of good/bad and right or wrong.  

A good example of this may be the recent changes in attitude in western society.

But I think an important point is that it is delusional/illusional to belief that the mind has depth just as much it is delusional/illusional to think that the mind is flat, all of the time.  The important point is to stand back and question what is (or might be going on) - is it right for me to think that the mind is flat/has depth in this case (the decision I'm making, the policy I'm arguing for etc).

If I think the mind has depth, is that because my reference group also think that the mind has depth?  And maybe in some senses, it does have depth.

Analogy? Ants are 'mindless' but create (possibly optimal) environments for protection, feeding and reproduction. They can have no rational motive for doing it as they do.

I found it hard, almost impossible, and resisted the formulae posited in support of the flat mind.  

Perhaps the tension between psych and market needs to be considered in a framework which is not named 'flat mind'. Perhaps the name of this extraordinarily diverse set of concepts needs to be made much more positive. The course opened very many doors into aspects of both our culture and our individuality.

These two are not the same. I answered consistent with the first ask: what is monstrous and what is a masterpiece. All - save perhaps two more modest pieces - were by great masters. In that sense one could only respond with a nine at least, which I did. (Altho I seem to have fallen into negative group far too often when results were displayed. I rarely gave less than a nine.) For those whose interests have not followed art, it might have been a test of preference, like or dislike. But the answers should have been related to masterpiece or not.

I think without the base concepts from previous learning I may have struggled with the way professor Nick chose to package his material.  

I'd be interested to how many of those that worked through the course and found it beneficial already had a grounding in some of the subjects as for me the course didn't do enough to introduce the concepts before assembling them into the over-arching concept.

People are influenced by context and comfort and media and friends. Government policy is to get reelected. There are many rich pressure groups putting pressure on governments to determine policy. They can influence the media too. If a person is extremely poor they are not concerned by taxation or environmental protection. Their comfort depends on social services assistance and charity. They may not even vote so preferential treatment by the government is given to the strongest voice. 

Should we still try to ‘maximise happiness’ in some sense, or is this misguided if it’s not clear what peoples’ preferences even are?

I believe people will always want to feel like they are in control. However, I also believe that modern society is now becoming less responsible for itself with Nanny Governments in the West.  i.e.  Individuals like to pass on the risk, the blame or the responsibility onto another person or entity. Therefore, I would argue that people like to have a choice, but don't wish to shoulder the burden of responsibility to that choice, especially if there is potential for something going wrong.  Its like a ''Buy Now, Pay much, much later'' scenario. 

Surely Happiness and fulfilment comes from your own decisions, good or bad. 

Going off topic a little, look at east Berlin during the 1940s to 1980s, and the lives they were pushed into.  Their choices were often made for them. It appeared to be a very grey and bland existence and you could argue that the people were not happy.

Primary School Children are learning already that it is cleverer and more fun to work for the common good of a class/school/town/country/planet, than selfishly and destructively to look only after ones own needs and those of our 'tribe'.
There are already many examples in various countries (Australia/Germany/Sweden/et) were new models of sustainable living have been created.

With regards to the paintings I wasn't influenced by other ratings, I liked what I liked, if I was indifferent I went for a 4/5 which possibly could be a little too high. 
The notion that the mind is flat I believe has something to it, end are so easily influenced and it backs up the theory that you become like the ten people you spend most time around. 
I do believe though that there is more to us than just the mind, a deeper spiritual essence that I suppose the mind can block when it runs away with itself. The question is can you think about whst your thinking is doing to you? Can you buck the trend and question things? Facebook is a prime example how people can be so easily influenced and sent thinking a certain way.
So the score for the mind is flat is a difficult one, for some people I could put it at 8 or 9, for others 2 or 3.
